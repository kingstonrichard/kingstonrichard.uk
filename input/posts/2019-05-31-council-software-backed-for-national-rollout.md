Continuing the conversation about [our Income Management System](/20190522), the Chronicle released an article today about it and its potential to be rolled out into other local government organisations.

[The article](https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/council-software-backed-for-national-roll-out) is a little presumptious in it's title but correctly highlights that conversations are happening to see if we can make that a reality.

So far we've spoken with several council's, the Gov.UK Pay team (part of the Government Digital Service) and in a couple of weeks time, [Dave](https://twitter.com/davidrob2002) and I will be heading to the [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office) to meet with colleagues from the [Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) - specifically in the [Local Digital Collaboration Unit](https://localdigital.gov.uk/).

I'll post more about that afterwards but for now I'm very happy to be continuing the conversations and looking forward to seeing it all pan out.
