Our local paper published a story about our [Income Management system](/20190522) today and the potential for it's future rollout.

Continuing the conversation about our Income Management System, the Chronicle released an article today about it and its potential to be rolled out into other local government organisations.

[The article](https://www.barnsleychronicle.com/article/council-software-backed-for-national-roll-out) is a little presumptious in it's title but correctly highlights that conversations are happening to see if we can make that a reality.

So far we've spoken with several council's, the Gov.UK Pay team (part of the Government Digital Service) and in a couple of weeks time, [Dave](https://twitter.com/davidrob2002) and I will be heading to the [Home Office](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/home-office) to meet with colleagues from the [Ministry of Housing, Culture and Local Government](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-and-local-government) - specifically in the [Local Digital Collaboration Unit](https://localdigital.gov.uk/).

I'll post more about that afterwards but for now I'm very happy to be continuing the conversations and looking forward to seeing it all pan out.
