As we look to kick off the alpha phase of our project, we've been busy describing our vision, our goals and thinking about the people and roles we need to succeed.

Here's who we have:

* Deliver Manager - Matt, Barnsley
* Product Manager - Saul, DXW
* Transformation Manager - Isobel, DXW
* User Researcher - Sam, DXW
* Service Owner - Rich, Barnsley
* Service Designer - Alan, Dorset
* Subject Matter Expert (Finance) - Debbie, Barnsley
* Subject Matter Expert (Legal) - Steve, Barnsley
* Design Authority - Tony, Huntingdonshire
* Design Authority - Glen, Dorset
* Design Authority - David, Barnsley
* Designer - Aidan, Barnsley
* Developer - Zoe, Barnsley
* Developer - Steve, Dorset

It's a large team. We won't have everyone working 100% of the time. The right people will be involved in the right sessions at the right time.

That said, we are going make sure everyone takes part in the kick off session to share a good understanding of why we're doing this and how we can each contribute. We're creating a team here and as we learned during the Discovery phase, it's invaluable creating that shared, friendly environment for working together, nice and early.

I'm looking forward to getting started, to contributing, collaborating, being challenged, being very far outside my comfort zone and to learning as much as possible.
