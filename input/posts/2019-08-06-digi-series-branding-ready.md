Thank you to everyone who helped us [name the first three prototypes](/20190402) that we produced in our Innovation Group.

This naming format ties in nicely with our Digital First initiative and gives us a nice model to follow in the future. We're already working on a DigiSafe prototype and there are other ideas in the pipeline that suit too.

That said, we set our friendly neighbourhood web designer Aidan Minton (who happens to be a qualified Graphic Designer) to work creating a branding proposal around the "Digi" concept and here are the results:

The beauty of the concept here is that we can simply change the colour and <NAME> element to suit any new prototype we develop without needing hours of work to produce a new brand each time. 

We're looking next into the possibility of registering a trademark around the naming convention and securing domain names for any marketing / sales websites we might associate with them.

Onwards and upwards!
