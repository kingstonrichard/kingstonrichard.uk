Turns out we published [our earlier draft requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4) that were asking for a Digital Specialist, rather than the latest version that asks for a Digital Outcome. As a result, all of the questions we received seemed irrelevant or confused - in fact, some of them were more statements advising we ask for an outcome, which we thought we had!

So, we pulled them again today and we plan to regroup and go out again next week. Apologies to anyone who submitted a question or showed an interest in the work. We do still require support and we will be back shortly.

To be clear, we're looking for an organisation to run our Discovery project. To marshall our stakeholders and carry out user research workshops with them. To document findings into a business/benefits case, a user research report, a conclusion and if appropriate, a funding bid to the Local Digital Fund to proceed with an Alpha project.

Ideally the succesful organisation will bring at least one: user researcher, service designer, product owner, delivery manager to get us to that point within the timescales set out by the fund - 31st January 2020.

We've listed our user stories as:

* As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.
* As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.
* As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.
* As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.

There's much more detail in the Google Sheet linked above.

To our stakeholders, bear with us please - we'll be out with our requirements again next week and will be looking to shortlist providers very soon after that. I'll be in touch with dates as soon as possible.

One final note, to thank Egle at MHCLG for all her support to date, and to Tony Evans for his comments on our requirements as they were being revised. we've found your input extremely useful so thank you for that.

I hope next week to be posting less about procurement and more about delivery. Watch this space.
