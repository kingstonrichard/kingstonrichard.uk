We've brought together all the detail from our [LDG funding bid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4), [tender requirements](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4), [YouTube show & tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA), [blog posts](https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management), [Slack channel](https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/) and [inception week](/20191115) into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map.

We made use of Google Docs, Miro and Slack to do this which have proven to be extremely useful tools, not only for collaborating remotely, but even to work more openly together when we're sitting in the same room. As [Sharon](https://twitter.com/pixlz) quite nicely put it "Part of the reason for talking [in Slack] rather than via DM [or email] is so that the conversation can be 'overheard'". Both Google Docs and Slack also have fantastic features that allow you to "see" each other working and making changes to documents in real time!

Miro in particular has helped us to digitise the post-it notes from our inception week and draw out some key themes around our thinking and our ambitions for the project. Understanding these now puts our team on the same clear page and sets out effective markers for the scope of what we're up to: 

* Why we are doing this work?
* What outcomes are we looking for?
* What organisations and stakeholders are involved?
* What outcomes will they get?
* What do we need to learn or prove?
* What do we need to communicate?
* What other work relates to this?
* What difficulties might we expect along the way?

In the meantime, our [Discovery Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/) now more cleanly outlines the background to our project, [the research queries we need to answer](/20190916), the user groups we need support from, the dates we'll be working to and how we'll communicate throughout. Show and tells will be a big part of that and we'll set to work figuring out how to stream those live on YouTube next week for those who want to be involved but can't necessarily attend in person. Our daily standups are likely to use Zoom for the days we're not together too.

Our [Stakeholder Map](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/) identifies absolutely everyone we want to engage with throughout the course of our Discovery work and using an interest vs. influence grid, we've put them into 4 key groups to help us manage how we most appropriately communicate with them. Communication tools have been identified to include show & tells, week notes, user research sessions, road mapping exercises, documentation and "other" which gives us a bit of freedom to cover off specific needs as and when they arise.

As we kick our communication plan into action next week, you might hear from Sharon, Marianne or James at DXW Digital. Please keep an eye out for their messages and respond as quickly as possible to enable us to carry out as much research as possible in the time we have available. The more information we can gather now, the better the outcome of the project overall.
