In preperation for us focussing our efforts on the feasibility and viability considerations of our project, [Saul](https://twitter.com/saulcozens) and [James](https://twitter.com/floppy) have pulled together a number of different documents for us to review when we start back next week:

* [A mindmap of the model for a software platform](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvxjiRY=/)
* [A list of openly shared software tools already out in the marketplace](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F91HlWR8X5a8EvEPLfEAGweyi2LzQNSqhORLVoluokk/)
* [A list of models for buying software platforms](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHIl5p3YlAVhJ4OMx4DXVo0oT8SPoMxQWbxno8BCkt8/)

In addition to these, we've also planned a session with some of our key decision makers in Barnsley on the 16th to discuss our Business Goals as an organisation. 

Together, these two pieces give us a really strong start to the work that I mentioned [last week](/20191227).
