Well, that's the first time I've ever submitted a project exception report citing a global pandemic as the reason for being delayed. Let's hope it's the only time I ever have to do it!

Since lockdown began, we've all obviously been extremely busy supporting our [local responses to the situation](/20200415) and I'm very thankful to MHCLG for their reassurance that our project was under no pressure to start. We are now though starting to see the initial surge of Covid-19 work calm down and while it's nowhere near "finished", it feels the time is right to see if we can start to make some headway on our [IMS Alpha](/20200313). 

While we're still realistically another fortnight from kicking anything off fully, speaking with [Saul](https://twitter.com/saulcozens) at [DXW](https://dxw.com), Tony at [Huntingdonshire District Council](https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/) and Glen at [Dorset](https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/home.aspx) there are some activities we can be progressing.

So this week we've had an initial conversation to grease the wheels and over the coming weeks we'll set about recapping on the discovery phase of our work, tidying up the scope of the alpha phase and forming up the team.
