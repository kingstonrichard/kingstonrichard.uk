So, here is the culmination of the 21 weeks worth of effort that concluded in our [Final Show & Tell](/20200131) on Jan 31st:

* [Final Discovery Report](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GO2soISYCRZVdPl2armyzIhgg0rqjdOiiVLCDvsDcfI)

All of the following documents are linked from inside the main report, but I'll add them here for completeness:

* [Proposed Future Roadmap](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwcvjM0=/?userEmail=marianne@dxw.com&track=true)

* [Service Provisioning Models](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHIl5p3YlAVhJ4OMx4DXVo0oT8SPoMxQWbxno8BCkt8) giving us options that we need to consider during an alpha project

* [Our riskiest assumptions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wC-u0WDaaNruNAyj1dvnG8d8GF-qXJ1K9cMXKG8zT7U/edit#gid=0) that we knew we needed to test during our research
* [Our list of IMS processes](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kweacBY=/) that outline what the Income Management System does and importantly doesn't do

Next steps for the team will be to consider submitting an application to the [Local Digital Fund](https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/) to progress our work on to the [alpha stage](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works).

Watch this space and thank you again, so much, to everyone for your engagement the project so far.
