Focussed on User Research and needs so far.

Also need to tackle our other queries:

* whether there is a market for an alternative Income Management system to those legacy products already out there
* what are the user needs for a good Income Management product amongst local authorities?
* whether our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific to our needs and set up - what do they need that we haven't thought about?
* whether changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?
* whether our income management system can integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it
* if an income management system could be built and shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?

Our user stories were:

* As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.
* As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.
* As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.
* As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.

There won't be an update over the next 2 weeks as our project is taking a pause over the festive period. We reconvene on the afternoon of January 6th in a Sprint Planning session and then spend January 7th in London with the GOV.UK Pay product team which I'm really looking forward to.

Wishing you a fantastic Christmas and New Year!
