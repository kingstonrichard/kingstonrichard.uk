We hit "Barnsleigh" station (see what they did there?) around 9am and headed out to Meadowhall, before switching to Doncaster, Peterborough and then finally Huntingdon. On that last leg we caught up with Sharon and Marianne from DXW who had been travelling down separately. With all the trains having been on time, the brief walk into the town centre got us there around lunchtime and so we had time to get food & coffee for ourselves and then what Marianne referred to as Sugary Bribes for the session. We then pitched up to Huntingdon CIVIC CENTRE - CHECK THIS - and set up in one of their Civic Rooms.

The session went really well! Thank you to everyone who took part and engaged as you did!

We spent the rest of our week analysing not only our new findings from Huntingdon but also the shape of our user research overall. It's encouraging to see common themes emerging and how they're mapping out into our [Forces framework](https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png).

As we head into the festive break now, there won't be an update over the next 2 weeks as our project takes a pause. We'll reconvene on the afternoon of January 6th in a Sprint Planning session and we're spending January 7th in London with the GOV.UK Pay product team which I'm really looking forward to.

Reflecting on progress to date - at this point we've interviewed 3 of our 6 funded partners (Allerdale, North East Lincs and Huntingdonshire) and we have sessions organised in the New Year with the others (Cherwell & South Northants, Sheffield and of course the GOV.UK Pay team). We've also interviewed 3 other council's who have come forward since submitting our funding bid (bradford, ETC) and we've had 15 completions of our Local Gov Survey which will remain open until the middle of January incidentally. Please do share and complete that if you haven't already. We've also delivered 2 live streamed show and tell ceremonies which have been subsequently published on our Barnsley.Digital YouTube channel. 

We have however been focussed entirely on researching user needs so far though. We also need to make sure we tackle our other lines of enquiry:

Looking back at our WHAT DID WE CALL THESE, we asked:

* whether there is a market for an alternative Income Management system to those legacy products already out there
* what are the user needs for a good Income Management product amongst local authorities?
* whether our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific to our needs and set up - what do they need that we haven't thought about?
* whether changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?
* whether our income management system can integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it
* if an income management system could be built and shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?

Our user stories were:

* As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.
* As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.
* As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.
* As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.

To that end, while we're in London on the 7th we'll be visiting DXW's London office in DSFSDFSDF. There we'll be bringing together software engineers from Barnsley, DXW and Huntingdonshire to disuss HOSTING OPTIONS.




Wishing you a fantastic Christmas and New Year!
