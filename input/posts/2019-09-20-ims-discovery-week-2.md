For [our Discovery project](https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/), we've agreed Barnsley team:

* Richard Kingston - Product Owner
* Debbie Cooper - Service Owner
* Zoe Crosby - Developer

 We've also engaged with our Contracts & Commissioning colleagues. We need their support to make an application to the [Digital Marketplace](https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/). Our intent is to make use of the [Digital Specialist and Outcomes framework](https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/) that the marketplace offers to secure a Delivery Manager. We want to work with someone who is familiar with running Discovery projects, to both run this project and educate our team to be able to run future ones on our own.

Coincidentally, some members of our Digital Team (who we work with very closely) have recently attended the [GDS Agile for Teams](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agile-for-teams-course-description) workshop and we'll be supporting a seperate Discovery project that they're running. Learning from both of these exercises (internally and externally lead) should give us a good handle on how to change the way we work for the future. 

During this week I've re-read through the [Local Digital Fund Prospectus 2019/20](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-digital-fund-prospectus-2019-to-2020) and refreshed our understanding of the scope in which we'll be running this project. I've also noted the project outputs are due at the end of January 2020 which include:

* a business/benefits case
* a user research report
* a conclusion
* a first draft ‘to be user journey map’
* if appropriate, an application for additional funding

That gives us 21 working weeks if we accept that the funding was awarded at the end of week 1. Assuming we'll take up to 6 weeks to secure our Delivery Manager, that leaves us up to 14 weeks for the delivery itself. We're breaking that down as follows:

* Week 01: Funding awarded
* Week 02-07: Procure delivery manager
* Week 08-15: Run investigative workshops
* Week 16-21: Document outputs into reports

Obviously that will become more granular over time, but that's the aspiration at the moment.

We'll share links to all of our documentation, starting with our marketplace requirements shortly.
