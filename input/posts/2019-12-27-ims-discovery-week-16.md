While we're technically not working on our Discovery project this week or next, [James](https://twitter.com/floppy) at DXW Digital has still been busy, carrying out some desk based research around the viability and feasibility of rolling out our income management system nationally. Our [original set of research questions](/20190916), were broadly grouped into three areas: 

![Venn Diagram showing User Needs (desirability) vs Business Goals (viability) vs Tech Constraints (feasibility)](/assets/images/2019-12-27-venn-diagram.jpg)

To date, we've been focussing primarily on user needs and in the New Year we plan to switch our focus towards these other key elements. Specifically, what sort of operating models do council's need from us and what sort of arrangements would we need to embed in Barnsley to be able to operate them effectively.

While we're in London on the 7th interviewing the GOV.UK Pay product team, we'll also be visiting DXW's London office in Hoxton where we'll be holding a specific session to supplement James research. That session will involve technical people from Barnsley, DXW and Huntingdonshire discussing the various options that are possible.

While we wait for that session, I thought it might be useful to reflect on our wider project position. At this point in our project we've interviewed 3 of our 7 funded partners:

* [Allerdale Borough Council](https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/)
* [North East Lincolnshire Council](https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/)
* [Huntingdonshire District Council](https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/)

We have sessions organised in the New Year with the others: 

* [Cherwell District Council](https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/)
* [South Northamptonshire Council](https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/)
* [Sheffield City Council](https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/) 
* the GOV.UK Pay team

We've also interviewed 3 other council's who have come forward since submitting our funding bid:

* [Bradford Council](https://www.bradford.gov.uk/)
* [South Cambridgeshire District Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/)
* [Cambridgeshire County Council](https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/)

We've had 15 completions of our [Local Gov Survey]((https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12)) which will remain open until the middle of January. Please do share and complete that if you haven't already.

We've delivered 2 live streamed show and tells which have been subsequently published [on our YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0) and we've begun putting together the skeleton structure of our final project reports, ready to be populated with data as we analyse our findings.

For now though - wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
