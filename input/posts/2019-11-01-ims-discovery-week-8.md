The submission window on our tender process closed this week and paperwork is being pulled together for review.

Next week will see a tender pack delivered to us and the team here in Barnsley will evaluate them. Towards the end of the week, we'll meet suppliers and discuss their submissions in more detail.

The invitation for our bid partners to join us at both of those events is open, either to join us on-site here in Barnsley or remotely where we can facilitate it.
