We [concluded the Discovery phase of our project](/20200131) on Jan 31st and we almost immediately had to set about preparing for the next phase - Alpha.

We knew that progressing the project into an alpha phase was appropriate and that we'd need support from the fund once again to do that.



To that end we were approached by Huntingdonshire County Council and Dorset.
