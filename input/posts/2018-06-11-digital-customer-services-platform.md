The group was supportive of the intention, seemed excited by the opportunity it presents and I look forward to taking the full business case in next month.

To get to that stage it needs a little work on the tolerances for project delivery and the financials, but otherwise it's a great document that sets out clearly what we hope to achieve.

Long story short, it'll give us a single platform for the design of digital customer services. IT officers will be able to create and amend those themselves. Those processes will then be published as more than just eForms,  going out on voice assistants, chatbots and IoT devices. It'll also then provide a customer portal to allow tracking of submissions through those processes.

It's an exciting time and over the next couple of weeks I'll be putting a fair amount of effort into getting the business case ready.
