The general gist is that as the GOV.UK Pay product team have researched what would be needed to make their solution the tool of choice for taking payments across local government, they discovered that taking money is only a part of the problem. An equally troublesome issue is what to do with money once it's taken. It turns out a lot of council's have difficulties with the processes of managing income.

That's where [our income management system](/20190522) comes in - potentially offering a solution where one is needed, more cost effectively than the private sector currently offers and at the best possible time.

[The article](https://www.ukauthority.com/articles/barnsley-software-could-support-councils-take-up-of-govuk-pay/) generates some really positive kudos for Barnsley and I'm thrilled with it. Really proud of my excellent team and the fantastic work we’re doing. It’s great to think that our efforts could make a real difference for local gov colleagues and I look forward to continuing those conversations.
