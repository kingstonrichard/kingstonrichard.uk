We've just learned that our Income Management System has been shortlisted at the [Public Finance Awards 2020](https://publicfinanceawards.co.uk/2020-shortlist/) in the Digital Finance Project of the Year category!

Having just completed our [Discovery project](/tags/Local-Digital-Fund) the timing could be better and the team are thrilled.

We're up against some tough competition by the looks of things with DWP, DEFRA, NHS Shared Business Services, Tewkesbury Council and Caring Together in the mix.

The ceremony for this is on April 23rd, just a month after the ceremony for the [LGC Awards 2020](/20191117) that our [Innovation Group](/tags/Innovation-Group) has also been nominated for. 

Fingers crossed at both events!
