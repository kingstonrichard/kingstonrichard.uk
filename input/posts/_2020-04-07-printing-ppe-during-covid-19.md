3D Verkstan design, using the print guide at https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/protective-visor-print-guide/.

Great success with 99 going out of the door relatively quickly. The first 93 of those were printed

Running our Innovation Group I'm lucky to have access to some pretty nice tech. FDM and SLA 3D printers, soldering stations, toolkits, osciloscopes - all the usual toys you'd expect to find in your typical makerspace.

Ours is a relatively small makerspace, but it forms part of a larger whole in that we'll soon be opening a new, larger one and our main town centre library (Library@The Lightbox) has one too. They're all part of a single larger "campus" that aims to be open and available to all.

So having been sat at home social distancing for a week or so, a number of us got to wondering how we might help with the Covid-19 effort and the topic of PPE came up.
