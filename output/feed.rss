			<title>Submitting our IMS Alpha bid</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/submitting-our-alpha-bid</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We finished up the Discovery phase of our IMS project on January 31st and sent our findings back to MHCLG. In those findings was a recommendation that the project should progress to an alpha phase - to try out different solutions to the problems we'd identified during our discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We finished up the Discovery phase of our IMS project on January 31st and sent our findings back to MHCLG. In those findings was a recommendation that the project should progress to an alpha phase - to try out different solutions to the problems we'd identified during our discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very next Monday, Feb 3rd, with the application window for the next round of Local Digital Funding already open, we set about drafting &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mJ8Mb2o-f2FdQJgNEcEsaalXpaokD0PutbURlcZldwc"&gt;our funding application&lt;/a&gt; as an open Google Doc and we invited potential collaborators to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, who had provided signicant knowledge and expertise throughout our Discovery work were quick to engage. Through a shared IT service, they represent the 3 councils of Cambridge City, South Cambridgeshire and Huntingdon, all of whom are interested in taking on the Barnsley IM system should it make it through to a Beta phase in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk/"&gt;Dorset Council&lt;/a&gt; contacted us shortly after too and offered to help. Their story is remarkably similar to Barnsley's in that they've developed their own income management system for the same reasons we did. The more we spoke, the more it felt like we'd been going through a lot of the same challenges over the last few years and at the same times, from restructures to changes in political direction, to troublesome contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd identifed during Discovery that the alpha phase was likely to need a smaller group of collaborators. Between the three of us, and with the support of dxw once again, this felt like a good way forward and so on February 14th, we submitted our bid. Later that same evening, we received an invite to be interviewed - to present our bid and to take questions, feedback and challenge from a panel of experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/222/2020/03/FundPanelRound4-2-620x346.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Dave and I presenting our proposal to the room" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dorset weren't available today unfortunately, but Dave and I arranged to meet up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt; and Tony from Huntingdonshire to deliver it. . It seemed to go well. There was good engagement in the room, some well thought out questions and challenges and we walked away with an idea of some changes we wanted to make to the bid document. All told, I'd say a very good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYnC0MpF7UOj3yKeJE8Qml9S2bXxOccf4C7H5REJJjg"&gt;Google Slides presentation&lt;/a&gt; is available to view here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wait now to hear the verdict and I'll post here when the results are in.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 21 finale</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-21-finale</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We've had a blast! I can honestly say this has been one of the most enjoyable projects I've worked on in my 20 years at Barnsley Council. We've worked outside the walls of the organisation, travelled to various places, connected with so many of our counterparts in other councils, worked with new tools and technologies, eaten our body weight in chocolate pretzels and presented our wares to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We've had a blast! I can honestly say this has been one of the most enjoyable projects I've worked on in my 20 years at Barnsley Council. We've worked outside the walls of the organisation, travelled to various places, connected with so many of our counterparts in other councils, worked with new tools and technologies, eaten our body weight in chocolate pretzels and presented our wares to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe not the world, but what started out as &lt;a href="/20190102"&gt;a small software development project to build an Income Management System for Barnsley&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of last year has taken us on quite a journey. It's ended up being something that's generated a lot of interest around the country and could now potentially deliver significant benefit to the public sector. We put ourselves out there because it felt like the right thing to do and the response has been really encouraging. The system itself has even been &lt;a href="/20200130"&gt;shortlisted for an award&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2020-01-31-slide-deck.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Our slide deck" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final Show &amp;amp; Tell for the project was on Tuesday and the planning and delivery of it dominated the first two days of this week. There was the organisation of how we'd set up the room, accommodate a large number of remote attendees, feed the people attending in person and we needed to squeeze in a dry run too. I spent much of my time frantically tweaking my slide notes - does anyone else get that internal panic about your slides not making sense right before you go on?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPYVcZxXUAAQRs6?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" class="img-fluid" alt="Our Switching Forces Miro board" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our slides incidentally were an extract of our main &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vrBUy9jQuKuwhOk-v6FOh6IHSpAyL4s86qwiaH7J5dE"&gt;Discovery Report&lt;/a&gt; - we took a copy, reorganised a few things and arranged to split up their deliver between the team. Using presentation slides is a great way to write a report by the way. When we started the project I was expecting we'd have an enormous Word document at the end. Rather we have a Google Slides presentation that includes links out to the various Google Docs, Google Sheets and Miro Boards that we've created throughout the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPXv5BvWAAE8DZt?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" class="img-fluid" alt="Sharon, starting our show and tell presentation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began at 12 noon with lunch provided and a chance to meet &amp;amp; greet over the first hour. We'd asked people to join remotely a little before 1pm so that we could kick off on the hour and we were thrilled to see a large number of people dialled in and ready to go. Sharon had organised this through Eventbrite and sent out an introductory email the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPYVcY4X0AEA78t?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" class="img-fluid" alt="Me, presenting our conclusions and recommendations" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the presentation, we invited questions using &lt;a href="https://www.mentimeter.com/"&gt;Mentimeter&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed both remote attendees and people in the room to put questions forward in a seamless and fair way. It can be hard to chip in questions remotely when people in the room are shouting out, and so this ensured we got to every question asked in the order they were asked. I hadn't realised until the end, but there was a portable bluetooth microphone/speaker letting the remote people hear us during the slides - so we handed this around the room as people were answering questions. There were some really good questions, and interestingly, some of the answers came from the audience, not just the project team which showed great engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPXwh40XUAEME-I?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" class="img-fluid" alt="Debbie, telling us all what an IMS actually is" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing went really well I thought, despite a few nerves - you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJYIXMHpSE0"&gt;watch it all back on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. I'm absolutely thrilled with where we're at today. The report is strong, I'm very confident in our findings given the work we did to draw them out, our recommendation to move to alpha is appropriate and we have a solid base to move forward from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EPYVcanWsAAjpL_?format=jpg&amp;amp;name=4096x4096" class="img-fluid" alt="Our roadmap for the future" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd just then finally like to thank DXW Digital for everything they've done throughout the project. From that first meeting when they were so welcoming, to this final show &amp;amp; tell where they've pulled out all the stops and were the perfect hosts. They've been accommodating throughout, the skills and capabilities they've brought to the table have been exactly what the project needed and we've learned so much from them. So thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to all involved in the project from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We've just learned that our Income Management System has been shortlisted at the &lt;a href="https://publicfinanceawards.co.uk/2020-shortlist/"&gt;Public Finance Awards 2020&lt;/a&gt; in the Digital Finance Project of the Year category!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://publicfinanceawards.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PF-awards-2020-web_414-X-240-BANNER-748x429.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Public Finance Awards 2020" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having just completed our &lt;a href="/tags/Local-Digital-Fund"&gt;Discovery project&lt;/a&gt; the timing could be better and the team are thrilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're up against some tough competition by the looks of things with DWP, DEFRA, NHS Shared Business Services, Tewkesbury Council and Caring Together in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony for this is on April 23rd, just a month after the ceremony for the &lt;a href="/20191117"&gt;LGC Awards 2020&lt;/a&gt; that our &lt;a href="/tags/Innovation-Group"&gt;Innovation Group&lt;/a&gt; has also been nominated for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed at both events!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 20</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-20</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It's basically been a week of preparation this week as we look forward to our planned Show &amp;amp; Tell session next Tuesday. We reviewing all of our project outputs to make sure they present all of our findings, conclusions and recommendations in a way that makes sense to anyone not directly connected to the project.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It's basically been a week of preparation this week as we look forward to our planned Show &amp;amp; Tell session next Tuesday. We reviewing all of our project outputs to make sure they present all of our findings, conclusions and recommendations in a way that makes sense to anyone not directly connected to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still had a few gaps to fill around the feasibility research we've been doing and so there's been some more desk research and we had a video call with Neil Williams (Oxford) and Guy Giles (Looking Local) where we discussed provisioning models in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a really good call that and while some of it went over my head again, it really cemented one or two things in Saul's mind I think. It certainly helped us to progress that area of our research and I was hugely encouraged by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Show &amp;amp; Tell next week we're inviting people to attend the DXW Leeds office in person for some lunch at 12 noon and the presentation at 1pm. If attending in person isn't an option, then we'll be streaming the event live using Zoom and inviting questions with Mentimeter afterwards. Very excited for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we look forward to celebrating the work we've done, I spent Friday preparing for another potential celebration - the development team behind our IMS system have been &lt;a href="/20191117"&gt;shortlisted for an LGC Award&lt;/a&gt; at this years event. I had to go down to London and present the work we've been doing as a development team both with software and IoT devices. Fingers crossed for them - let's hope the 4:15am start pays off!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 19</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;We started the week interview &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; using our revised discussion guide. They've recently undergone some changes with regards to the organisation of their IMS function and technologies and that made for a really interesting session. We decamped to Tamper afterwards which serves amazing coffee and unravelled the learning from our brains before climbing the stair mountain back to the car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2020-01-17-car-stairs.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The staircase to the car" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having closed our survey on Monday, we then spent Wednesday in Leeds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boiling down all the needs we'd heard from all of our research into a set of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W4FUQWcu3EHC21ZZNTbOnMJfEkGuejbUI5NTLxm4j_I"&gt;user need statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summing up our tech chats into &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvxjiRY=/"&gt;a digestable &amp;quot;onion&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; that we could present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agreeing our conclusions, recommendations and options for 'what next?'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working on the benefits case for the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating our roadmap for the future - key activities, measures of success, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this would feed into our end of project report which we presented a lightweight version of to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidRob2002"&gt;Dave Robinson&lt;/a&gt; (Head of Service) and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LoyKerry"&gt;Kerry Loy&lt;/a&gt; (Commercial Services Manager) at Barnsley MBC - where the aim was to discuss the viability aspects of our research. Based on everything we'd learned, was their the political will and support in Barnsley to take this forward... to an alpha project and potentially beyond. Could / would Barnsley be able to organise themselves around the work and commit resource to more delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2020-01-17-post-its.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Post it notes from an earlier session" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having discussed all the various in's, out's, up's and down's the answer was &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;. We can and are prepared to commit resource to supporting an alpha activity - to take the next steps and see where we end up. I have to say I'm chuffed to bits at that. It demonstrates that the value of our work can be seen and the potential value of it to the public sector is clear. It's great news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that knowledge I went into a video call on the Thursday afternoon with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JackRicketts8"&gt;Jack Ricketts&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.southwark.gov.uk/"&gt;Southwark Council&lt;/a&gt; and Amanda Pujol from &lt;a href="https://www.teignbridge.gov.uk/"&gt;Teinbridge District Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle&lt;/a&gt; had set up an opportunity for us to chat as lead officers of 3 funded projects focussed on progressing back office systems. I'm so glad she did, I found it so reassuring to hear similar stories and experiences in their projects as we were having in ours. Not only that, but I've made a couple of new contacts for the future there and while Jack's project had just completed its alpha phase, I'll be looking to support Amanda's discovery phase as that progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 18</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-18</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We began the week with a little Sprint Planning, setting out the change in direction and agreeing the adjustments we needed to make that would allow that to happen. Practically that meant changing some of the questions in our discussion guide - a document that's been steering our user research sessions from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We began the week with a little Sprint Planning, setting out the change in direction and agreeing the adjustments we needed to make that would allow that to happen. Practically that meant changing some of the questions in our discussion guide - a document that's been steering our user research sessions from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having adjusted the questions in there to have more of a feasibility and viability focus, while still being open, we took the opportunity to make sure we were getting all the information that we needed. That sounds a little daft, but earlier in the project we'd had some feedback from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle&lt;/a&gt; at MHCLG about things that our project outputs must include. We ran a gap analysis there and made sure we were covering the missing topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2020-01-10-white-board.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="The conference room at the DXW Digital office in Hoxton" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday we had two really good sessions down in London. In the morning we spent time in &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt;'s Hoxton office with colleagues from &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, discussing feasibile operating models - reference &lt;a href="/20200103"&gt;Saul's earlier mindmap&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially how might we offer and run our IMS such that other council's can use it. Saas? Multi-tenanted? Multi-instanced? Open sourced? Costed? How might support work? Did we need a Service Desk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long and short of it is that the software itself is only a very small piece of the puzzle. In fact &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; smallest piece! Council's need support arrangements, assurances that the product has longevity, real-time access to its data, procurement rules and approaches to consider, audit requirements to adhere to, the list goes on! I admit some of this flew over my head but Saul had it down, and when he paired up with James on it later to digest it, all became much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we had a wander through Shoreditch and over to The White Chapel Buiding in... Whitechapel. That's the home of the GOV.UK Pay prduct team and it was lovely to see them all again - we'd met &lt;a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/katie-bates-a053b236"&gt;Katie Bates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiriamAliceR"&gt;Miriam Raines&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="/20190613"&gt;earlier in our IMS journey&lt;/a&gt; when we'd supported their Discovery work with &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2020-01-10-white-chapel.png" class="img-fluid" alt="The White Chapel Building in Whitechapel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that session we very briefly discussed some of the integration requirements with the Pay product that we'd identified and whether or not certain things were possible. They were, so happy days! We spent the rest of that session support their next Discovery project into automated telephone payment systems - we have everything crossed that that work will lead to an alpha project that we can support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Wednesday we interviewed &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/"&gt;South Northamptonshire Council&lt;/a&gt;. Sharon had stayed over in London and travelled up where James had joined her. The Barnsley contingent joined in remotely and we put our revised discussion guide into practice. Another fantastic session and the findings from it fit beautifully into our Switching Forces diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we did on Thursday. We spent the day back in Leeds analysing all of our learning to date updating our various project output documents - including preparing our final end of project report in readiness for the 31st Jan deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday we supplemented our Hoxton session with desk research looking for other successful co-developed open source provisioning models outside local government, trying to find something relevant and meaningful but it turns out what we're trying to do is fairly unique in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In preperation for us focussing our efforts on the feasibility and viability considerations of our project, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; have pulled together a number of different documents for us to review when we start back next week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvxjiRY=/"&gt;A mindmap of the model for a software platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F91HlWR8X5a8EvEPLfEAGweyi2LzQNSqhORLVoluokk/"&gt;A list of openly shared software tools already out in the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHIl5p3YlAVhJ4OMx4DXVo0oT8SPoMxQWbxno8BCkt8/"&gt;A list of models for buying software platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, we've also planned a session with some of our key decision makers in Barnsley on the 16th to discuss our Business Goals as an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these two pieces give us a really strong start to the work that I mentioned &lt;a href="/20191227"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 16</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-16</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;While we're technically not working on our Discovery project this week or next, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; at DXW Digital has still been busy, carrying out some desk based research around the viability and feasibility of rolling out our income management system nationally. Our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;original set of research questions&lt;/a&gt;, were broadly grouped into three areas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While we're technically not working on our Discovery project this week or next, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; at DXW Digital has still been busy, carrying out some desk based research around the viability and feasibility of rolling out our income management system nationally. Our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;original set of research questions&lt;/a&gt;, were broadly grouped into three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-27-venn-diagram.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Venn Diagram showing User Needs (desirability) vs Business Goals (viability) vs Tech Constraints (feasibility)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, we've been focussing primarily on user needs and in the New Year we plan to switch our focus towards these other key elements. Specifically, what sort of operating models do council's need from us and what sort of arrangements would we need to embed in Barnsley to be able to operate them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're in London on the 7th interviewing the GOV.UK Pay product team, we'll also be visiting DXW's London office in Hoxton where we'll be holding a specific session to supplement James research. That session will involve technical people from Barnsley, DXW and Huntingdonshire discussing the various options that are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we wait for that session, I thought it might be useful to reflect on our wider project position. At this point in our project we've interviewed 3 of our 7 funded partners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/"&gt;Allerdale Borough Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sessions organised in the New Year with the others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/"&gt;South Northamptonshire Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also interviewed 3 other council's who have come forward since submitting our funding bid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had 15 completions of our &lt;a href="(https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12)"&gt;Local Gov Survey&lt;/a&gt; which will remain open until the middle of January. Please do share and complete that if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've delivered 2 live streamed show and tells which have been subsequently published &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0"&gt;on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and we've begun putting together the skeleton structure of our final project reports, ready to be populated with data as we analyse our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though - wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 15</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-15</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our "Southern" workshop took place in Huntingdon at &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;'s Pathfinder House when we arrived there in the afternoon. We set off from "Barnsleigh" station (see what they did there?) at around 9am and headed out to Meadowhall, before switching to Doncaster, Peterborough and then finally Huntingdon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;Southern&amp;quot; workshop took place in Huntingdon at &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;'s Pathfinder House when we arrived there in the afternoon. We set off from &amp;quot;Barnsleigh&amp;quot; station (see what they did there?) at around 9am and headed out to Meadowhall, before switching to Doncaster, Peterborough and then finally Huntingdon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-barnsleigh.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Train arrives at Barnsleigh Station" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that last leg we caught up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marriane&lt;/a&gt; from DXW who had been travelling down separately. With all the trains having been on time, the brief walk into the town centre got us there around lunchtime and so we had time to get food &amp;amp; coffee and then what Marianne referred to as Sugary Bribes for the session. We pitched up to Huntingdon and set up in one of their Civic Rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-discussion.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Discussion by the post it boards" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session went really well! Thank you to everyone who took part and engaged as you did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-mapping.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Mapping out process flows" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of our week analysing not only our new findings from Huntingdon but also the shape of our user research overall. It's encouraging to see common themes emerging and how they're mapping out into our &lt;a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png"&gt;Forces framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we head into the festive break now, there won't be an update over the next 2 weeks as our project takes a pause. We'll reconvene on the afternoon of January 6th in a Sprint Planning session and we're spending January 7th in London with the GOV.UK Pay product team which I'm really looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 14</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-14</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A very busy week and so a long post this time! We've interviewed, we've workshopped, we've reached out, we've analysed survey responses and we've scheduled future activities for all of those things and more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A very busy week and so a long post this time! We've interviewed, we've workshopped, we've reached out, we've analysed survey responses and we've scheduled future activities for all of those things and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week started on December 9th with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; visiting &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their requirements of an Income Management System. Zoe, Debbie and I were due to attend remotely but the GoTo Meeting software let us down at the last minute and we unfortunately couldn't take part. We did however review the notes after the meeting and by all accounts it was a really useful session. Thank you so much to everyone there who supported that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 10th we popped over to Leeds and ran our agile ceremonies. Starting with our Sprint Review in the morning, we live streamed our very first Show &amp;amp; Tell of the project which is now available to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0"&gt;view on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. We all agreed afterwards that we spoke a little fast and perhaps before the next one we should spend a bit of time getting comfortable. But we're happy with it, it includes everything we wanted to say, and the tech worked great - using DXW's 360 degree &lt;a href="https://www.owllabs.com/meeting-owl"&gt;Meeting Owl Camera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; in their conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed up in the afternoon with our Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning sessions. The Retrospective was particularly useful and gave our Barnsley contingent experience of a new way to run those sessions. Using post-it notes, we individually wrote down things that we'd liked, learned and wished throughout the previous sprint. There was a list of &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; things we noted too. We grouped together and discussed the common themes that were clear to see from us all. From the common wishes and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; items we voted individually on the ones we'd like to focus on over the coming sprint and lifted out the 5 top hitters. Against those we indivdiually wrote post-its identifying how we thought we could deliver against each and grouped those into common actions. The whole exercise was then digitised into a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvkMYm4=/"&gt;Miro Board&lt;/a&gt; and we'll make sure we deliver against the actions in the next sprint. Fantastically useful and a great way to reflect on all the activity to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-13-bradford-team.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday the 11th we ran a user research workshop in the DXW Leeds office with colleagues from &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;. We had originally intended for this to be our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; workshop, inviting councils from our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; who were all roughly grouped together towards the top of the country. However, we quickly hit up against one of the &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;lessons learned in previous Discovery projects&lt;/a&gt; that MHCLG had warned us about - that short notice availability, especially in the run up to Christmas, is a difficult thing to negotiate! So we'll be rescheduling other council's who couldn't attend but in the meantime we got a lot out of the session with Bradford who were fantastic! We also had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle Uzkuraityte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery"&gt;Lisa Jeffery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ImHuYorks"&gt;Imran Hussain&lt;/a&gt; in the room contributing their experience which we very much appreciate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-13-post-its.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week is a bit of a blur if I'm honest as we've had a lot of engagement. Amongst other things we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted &lt;a href="https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/"&gt;Kirklees Council&lt;/a&gt; in response to them contacting us on Twitter. We've added them to our Stakeholder Map and hope to be able to interview them shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Followed up with &lt;a href="https://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/"&gt;Warwick District Council&lt;/a&gt; who partially completed our Local Gov Survey. We've added them to our Stakeholder Map too and we'd love to speak to them in more detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaged in a conversation that Lisa Jeffery started on the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/"&gt;LocalGov Digital slack channel&lt;/a&gt; about our project and in particular some challenges about future of IMS systems generally from &lt;a href="https://www.midlothian.gov.uk/"&gt;Midlothian Council&lt;/a&gt;. Very keen to follow up on this further next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised our train tickets for travelling to Huntingdon on Wednesday where we'll hold our &amp;quot;Southern&amp;quot; workshop with &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted colleagues at our partner &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; to organise a date to interview them remotely in the New Year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised a face to face interview the GOV.UK Pay product team on January 7th next year at their offices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised a face to face interview with &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; on January 14th at their premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received an email from Egle providing advice and guidance on the detail we need to make sure is included in our end of project reports. We'll be digesting that ASAP and make sure our research questions and delivery plan cover the elements we need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented Google Analytics into this blog so we can get an idea of interest and engagement in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 13</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-13</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you use or are connected to an Income Management System in Local Government, please take 15 minutes to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12"&gt;complete our Local Government Survey&lt;/a&gt; so that we can better understand IMS requirements across the sector. The data we capture through our survey will supplement findings from our face to face workshops and remote interviews and ultimately help the project to make a recommendation back to MHCLG in relation to our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to complete until some time in early January when we'll need to start processing the information given through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;If you use or are connected to an Income Management System in Local Government, please take 15 minutes to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12"&gt;complete our Local Government Survey&lt;/a&gt; so that we can better understand IMS requirements across the sector. The data we capture through our survey will supplement findings from our face to face workshops and remote interviews and ultimately help the project to make a recommendation back to MHCLG in relation to our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to complete until some time in early January when we'll need to start processing the information given through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's open we'll continue with our workshops and interviews. On December 4th we carried out our first remote interview with &lt;a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/"&gt;Allerdale Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; who advised they wouldn't be able to make it to our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; workshop but as a partner are integral to our research. We think this interview went really well with Zoe and Debbie connected in from our Barnsley office, Marianne facilitating the session from the DXW office in Leeds and of course Allerdale dialled in from their office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-06-allerdale-remote.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Remote interview with Allerdale" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That interview allowed to us to generate the start of our &lt;a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png"&gt;Forces framework&lt;/a&gt;. This will let us see the common problems pushing councils away from their current income management solutions and the benefits they seek that would pull them towards a replacement. At the same time it will highlight their anxieties about moving to new solutions and any concerns they have that might be considered blockers. By mapping out our research findings in this way, we can generate a better understanding of the income management scene in Local Government and plot out the development work needed at an alpha stage to best position our Income Management System to suit their needs - thus answering some of &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. We'll continue to update that framework as we speak with other councils. Already it's also allowed us to refine &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;our question set&lt;/a&gt; for future interviews too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.strategyzer.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Forces_Diagram_Version_Strategyzer-3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Forces Framework" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that was all happening, we have organised a face to face interview on the 9th December with &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; and our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; Workshop is confirmed for the 11th with &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt; due to attend so far. We're also planning to see &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt; on the 18th of December and we're trying to organise to see the GOV.UK Pay product team and &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/"&gt;South Northamptonshire Council&lt;/a&gt; in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Zx6cuVodTosFEH2x6"&gt;Expression of Interest Form&lt;/a&gt; remains published for anyone else to get involved too.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 12</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-12</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;With a good understanding of what we're trying to acheive outlined in &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;our Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; we've focussed this week on getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With a good understanding of what we're trying to acheive outlined in &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;our Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; we've focussed this week on getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; we've been considering how best to engage and communicate with everyone we'd like to speak to. That includes our bid partners obviously, but also council's who have engaged in income management related work with us in the past. For example, those who supported the previous round 1 funded project - &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/gov-uk-pay-as-a-viable-alternative-e-payment-provider/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider in local government&lt;/a&gt; and those who joined &lt;a href="20190522"&gt;our first ever public show &amp;amp; tell about our income management system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're spread the length and breadth of the country and so we have to be a little strategic about how we reach them - or as many of them as possible in the time we have available. We had hoped to interview them all individually at their own premises but the logistics of that and the cost of travel these days just don't make that entirely practical. So instead we've grouped them geographically into &amp;quot;North&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;South&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Central&amp;quot; areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've then agreed to use the following methods to conduct our research with them including (in order of our preference):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face to face joint workshops - we'll run one of these in each geographical area and invite as many council's as possible from that area to attend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face to face on-site interviews - where it's still practical to do this, we will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote interviews - for those who can't meet with us in person, but still want to take part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online surveys - for those who can't spare as much time, but are still keen to input to our research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; face to face workshop we plan to run on December 11th. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marriane&lt;/a&gt; have issued invites to those in this area and have opened up a space at the &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com/"&gt;DXW Digital Leeds office&lt;/a&gt; for the day. Lunch will be provided and the workshop will, aligned with &lt;a href="/20191122"&gt;our key themes from last week&lt;/a&gt;, ask open questions designed to answer &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our research queries&lt;/a&gt;. The format of the day and accompanying slides are being pulled together as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with that (and indeed our future face to face workshops), we started this week mapping out the capabilities of our Income Management System and it's limitations. From a document that Zoe and Debbie produced, Marriane extrapolated out a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kweacBY=/"&gt;Miro board&lt;/a&gt; that generated a number of queries. Some were technical, others were simply to clarify understanding. All of them helped to create the initial set of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;open questions that will be asked through the course of our research&lt;/a&gt;, though this will be a living document, adjusted according to our research findings as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is not to say that this is a closed project. We're keen to speak with any council who wants to support our research and to that end we've published an &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Zx6cuVodTosFEH2x6"&gt;Expression of Interest Form&lt;/a&gt; to allow council's to join in. We'd like to get this in front of council's who may not have heard of the project yet or who are typically less engaged in these sorts of Discovery activities. We'd be very grateful for people sharing this as far and as wide as possible and we'll contact anyone and everyone who completes it. As council's contact us through it, we'll add them to our Stakeholder Map and loop them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of activity we've gone through this week has lead to us introducing two new tools to our team working arsenal - &lt;a href="https://trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. We've used Trello to map out our activities, identifying their current status and who is working on them. Dragging activity cards between various columns including &amp;quot;To do&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In progress&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot; whilst attaching our faces to the ones we're delivering has really helped us to make sure that everything that needs to be done is getting done, without us falling over each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom is a video conferencing tool that we're using to keep in touch and for our daily 10am standups. It creates a kind of Blankety Blank board (showing my age there!) of attendees and if one person has connectivity issues, it doesn't affect the others or the call itself. On our first day with it, Zoe and I were huddled around her laptop on a call when her battery ran out. Within 30 seconds I'd connected us back in using my personal phone and the call continued. Really easy to use and very flexible - the second day I was held up on the school run and so dialled in on my phone sat in the car outside school and it still worked just perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 11</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-11</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This week we've brought together all the detail from our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;LDG funding bid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;tender requirements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;YouTube show &amp;amp; tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map which are linked below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This week we've brought together all the detail from our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;LDG funding bid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;tender requirements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;YouTube show &amp;amp; tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map which are linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made use of Google Docs, Miro and Slack to do this which have proven to be extremely useful tools, not only for collaborating remotely, but even just to work more openly together when we're sitting in the same room. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; quite nicely put it &amp;quot;Part of the reason for talking [in Slack] rather than via DM [or email] is so that the conversation can be 'overheard' [by all parties]&amp;quot;. Both Google Docs and Slack also include fantastic features that allow you to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; each other working and making changes to documents in real time - you can literally see each other's mouse cursors! Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-22-miro-collaboration.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Miro showing collaborators pointers working in the same document" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miro in particular has helped us to digitise the post-it notes from our &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; and to draw out some key themes around our ambitions for the project. Getting these on 'paper' - visible in front of us - puts and keeps our team on the same clear page and it sets out effective markers for the scope of what we're up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why we are doing this work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes are we looking for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What organisations and stakeholders are involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes will they get?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to learn or prove?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to communicate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other work relates to this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What difficulties might we expect along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; now cleanly outlines the background to our project, &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;the research queries we need to answer&lt;/a&gt;, the user groups we need support from, the dates we'll be working to and how we'll communicate throughout. Show and tells will be a big part of that and we'll set to work figuring out how to stream those live on YouTube next week for those who want to be involved but can't necessarily attend in person. Our daily standups are likely to use Zoom for the days we're not together too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; identifies absolutely everyone we want to engage with and using an interest vs. influence grid we've put them into 4 key groups to help us manage how we most appropriately communicate with them. Communication tools have been identified to include show &amp;amp; tells, week notes, user research sessions, road mapping exercises, documentation and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; which gives us a bit of freedom to cover off specific needs as and when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1489/1*0rqkQR7ktS_eM7j7rrm_PQ.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interest vs Influence Grid" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we kick an action plan off next week, you might hear from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marianne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;) at DXW Digital. Please keep an eye out for their messages and respond as quickly as possible to enable us to carry out as much research as possible in the time we have available. The more information we can gather now, the better the outcome of the project overall.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Our new apprentice rocks!</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/our-new-apprentice-rocks</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Robyn joins us from &lt;a href="https://barnsley.ac.uk"&gt;Barnsley College&lt;/a&gt;, working 4 days a week split between my web team and our SAP team. On Monday's and Tuesday's she creates SAP programs using ABAP and on Wednesday's and Thursday's she builds websites and digital media tools. She spends her Friday's at college.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Robyn joins us from &lt;a href="https://barnsley.ac.uk"&gt;Barnsley College&lt;/a&gt;, working 4 days a week split between my web team and our SAP team. On Monday's and Tuesday's she creates SAP programs using ABAP and on Wednesday's and Thursday's she builds websites and digital media tools. She spends her Friday's at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she joined us we'd discovered that she had a talent for developing websites and that she was keen to learn as much as possible during her time with us. As it happened, we needed a new website developing and it was the perfect task for a ground up training exercise. It covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design and layout work, familiarisation with &lt;a href="https://umbraco.com"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt; (our WCM of choice), logo creation and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is now in her 8th week with us (so 16 days, or 3 working weeks) and so far she has wireframed her designs, adopted changes in response to critique from our in-house graphic designer, set up an empty Umbraco instance and began building the website in it AND she's developed a logo and brand identity for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-blog-design.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital website design" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm honestly blown away. Robyn's commitment and enthusiasm is infectious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website she's working on is a collaborative blog that we hope to use to showcase the digital economy in Barnsley. There are lots of fantastic digital projects happening across the borough and we want to provide an online space that can bring them all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mwtsn"&gt;Matt Watson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.makedo.net/"&gt;Make Do Ltd&lt;/a&gt; who donated to us a very fitting domain name, we're calling it Barnsley.Digital which incidentally mirrors similar concepts in other cities and towns - see &lt;a href="https://croydon.digital"&gt;Croydon Digital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digital.gateshead.gov.uk"&gt;Gateshead Digital&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-brand-identity.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital brand identity" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is due to be with us for some time yet and I'm very much looking forward to what else she'll be able to achieve. As her studies progress and her learning with us does too, she'll only improve further and further. Absolutely outstanding! Nice work Robyn!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>LGC Awards 2020 Finalist</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/iot-award-shortlist</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I learned today that a submission made to the LGC Awards 2020 has been shortlisted for an award in the Innovation category.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/iot-award-shortlist</guid>
			<pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I learned today that a submission made to the LGC Awards 2020 has been shortlisted for an award in the Innovation category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-17-iot-award.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="LGC Awards 2020 Finalist" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been running an Innovation Group for a little over a year now at Barnsley Council in which individuals from around the organisation are invited to prototype technology solutions to problems that aren't being tackled otherwise. One day per fortnight, we open up the doors to our Innovation Lab that contains a variety of useful equipment including 3D printers, soldering irons, voice assistants and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems identified so far have related to inefficiency in council processes and the solutions have been commercial in the sense that they could be made available to other councils. I've &lt;a href="/tags/Innovation-Group"&gt;blogged about them&lt;/a&gt; all previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, we think, is a fairly unusual thing amongst council's and its benefited hugely from new ways of working that are being tried and tested in the organisation. It's these ways of working, these new innovative approaches that are the subject of the submission. Our innovation group is a beneficiary of them - an example of what can and has been achieved. And incidentally the council is then a beneficiary of the group as it implements the solutions that are developed by it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll be interesting to see if the judges see the value as we do and I'm looking forward to the results.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 10</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-10</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt; were the succesful bidder in our tender exercise to secure delivery support for our Discovery project. They're a London and Leeds based agency that believe it’s possible for the public sector to become something recognisably, radically better, and want to help make that happen - which is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt; were the succesful bidder in our tender exercise to secure delivery support for our Discovery project. They're a London and Leeds based agency that believe it’s possible for the public sector to become something recognisably, radically better, and want to help make that happen - which is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sorted out the formalities through Tuesday, our Barnsley contingent set straight to work on Wednesday visiting their trendy Leeds offices and meeting their team. After a tour and a rather tasty coffee (thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/I_am_poss"&gt;Poss&lt;/a&gt;), we made ourselves comfortable in their conference space and set out our expectations for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-15-post-it-notes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Post-it notes setting out our expectations" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DXW Team (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marianne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;), Debbie, Zoe and I worked through the context of the project, a potted history to date, our ambitions, goals, hopes and dreams for it with a break for lunch somewhere in middle. This sat nicely with &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;the agenda we were anticipating last week&lt;/a&gt; and we used more post-it notes in a single day than I think I've personally used in the last decade! The whole process felt open, creative, flexible but at the same time really well choreographed. The energy only really dropped when someone mentioned lunch and that claimed our focus all too easily. Otherwise we got through an awful lot of material, highlighted a number of considerations, risks, issues and actions that we now need to follow up on - all of which will be digitised and made available as quick as we're able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-15-our-team.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Our team" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our inception meeting. A chance to set out where we are, where we need to be, to generate a shared understanding between us and importantly to gel as a core lead team. Next steps will include engaging with our bid partners (and agreeing with them how best to do this throughout the project), agreeing communication channels and carrying out our joint research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we added our project to Local Digital Pipeline for visibility, documented a functional list of the capabilities of our Income Management System and clarified our availability for further meetings and activities over the remaining 11 weeks of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was a day of rest. We've put together these week notes and caught up with some non-project related activities. Next week, we go again and we're very much looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 9</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-9</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We spent the majority of this week scoring bids from interested suppliers and I'm pleased to announce we'll be awarding a contract first thing next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<pubDate>Fri, 08 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate>
			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We spent the majority of this week scoring bids from interested suppliers and I'm pleased to announce we'll be awarding a contract first thing next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation panel met on Monday and reviewed paper submissions which included outline plans for project delivery, details of resources being deployed, pricing and experience of runnning similar projects to equally tight deadlines. We met with each supplier's teams to discuss their proposals both in person and virtually which helped to firm up our evaluations and get an understanding of how their paper submissions translated to real world practical activities. We ended the week with a real sense of confidence that we'll be able to deliver a meaningful discovery over the remaining 12 weeks of the project (accepting that 2 of those weeks are over the Christmas break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In readiness for a project kick off next week, we've secured a collaboration space in our &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; large enough to seat 7 people comfortably, with media services (Wi-Fi, screens, etc.) and importantly with walls for sticking things to! This is a lockable space that we can set up and leave, to use as we need. Huge thank you to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cr8tveBarnsley"&gt;Tracey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for that! This refers back to one &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;our early lessons in week 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to next week, we're meeting first thing Monday morning and will look to award the contract to the winning bidder as soon as possible. We'll confirm with them the date for our project kick-off and update the project team about when and where that will take place. We'll also need to confirm the agenda but I suspect that will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recap of the previous work carried out by NELC and the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A review of our project and it’s vision, goals and risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look at our timeline and outline project plan to January 31st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion about how we can best work together as a project team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps – planning for our first sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really looking forward to getting into the meat of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We'll receive copies of all the tender documentation submitted by interested parties early next week. Our colleagues in the corporate procurement team are currently carrying out their due diligence on them. Once we have them, we will begin our evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the week, we'll then meet suppliers and discuss their submissions in more detail, giving us an opportunity to ask any clarifying questions we might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invitation for our bid partners to join us at both of those events is still open, either to join us on-site here in Barnsley or remotely where we can facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>IMS Discovery - Week 7</title>
			<link>http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-7</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Our team in Barnsley have held clarification calls with several interested parties so far this week and we're encouraged by the conversations we've been having. All the questions asked of us have been noted along with our answers and they are being shared openly on our YorTender portal. This means that all suppliers have the benefit of seeing all the same information and will help to make sure all the submissions we receive are as appropriate as possible. We can't say too much about how many suppliers we've spoken with, or who they are as the whole process is confidential by nature, but we are keen to be as open as possible, hence still releasing this shorter blog post this week about how we're progressing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I'm on leave next week but the team here will be continuing to receive and answer questions via the portal throughout. When I return, the tender window will have closed and we can review submissions w/c 4th November. We've invited our partners to join us in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers will visit us to discuss their submissions in more detail on November 8th. Again, we've issued an invite to all partners to join us in that on-site here in Barnsley, or remotely where we can support that - keen to have as much involvement as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm conscious we still need to figure out how we're going to work together collaboratively as a project team. At the moment Barnsley continue to lead these early activities and are inviting support and comment at each stage. To that end the agile training hasn't been organised yet but is on our task list of things to do so isn't lost.&lt;/p&gt;
