		<content>&lt;p&gt;In preperation for us foccusing our efforts on the feasibility and viability considerations of our project, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; have pulled together a number of different documents for us to review when we start back next week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvxjiRY=/"&gt;A mindmap of the model for a software platform&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F91HlWR8X5a8EvEPLfEAGweyi2LzQNSqhORLVoluokk/"&gt;A list of openly shared software tools already out in the marketplace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHIl5p3YlAVhJ4OMx4DXVo0oT8SPoMxQWbxno8BCkt8/"&gt;A list of models for buying software platforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, we've also planned a session with some of our key decision makers in Barnsley on the 16th to discuss our Business Goals as an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these two pieces give us a really strong start to the work that I mentioned &lt;a href="/20191227"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 16</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-16" />
		<updated>2019-12-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;While we're technically not working on our Discovery project this week or next, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt; at DXW Digital has still been busy, carrying out some desk based research around the viability and feasibility of rolling out our income management system nationally. Our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;original set of research questions&lt;/a&gt;, were broadly grouped into three areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-27-venn-diagram.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Venn Diagram showing User Needs (desirability) vs Business Goals (viability) vs Tech Constraints (feasibility)" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, we've been focussing primarily on user needs and in the New Year we plan to switch our focus towards these other key elements. Specifically, what sort of operating models do council's need from us and what sort of arrangements would we need to embed in Barnsley to be able to operate them effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're in London on the 7th interviewing the GOV.UK Pay product team, we'll also be visiting DXW's London office in Hoxton where we'll be holding a specific session to supplement James research. That session will involve technical people from Barnsley, DXW and Huntingdonshire discussing the various options that are possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we wait for that session, I thought it might be useful to reflect on our wider project position. At this point in our project we've interviewed 3 of our 7 funded partners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/"&gt;Allerdale Borough Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sessions organised in the New Year with the others:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/"&gt;South Northamptonshire Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also interviewed 3 other council's who have come forward since submitting our funding bid:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had 15 completions of our &lt;a href="(https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12)"&gt;Local Gov Survey&lt;/a&gt; which will remain open until the middle of January. Please do share and complete that if you haven't already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've delivered 2 live streamed show and tells which have been subsequently published &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0"&gt;on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and we've begun putting together the skeleton structure of our final project reports, ready to be populated with data as we analyse our findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now though - wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our &amp;quot;Southern&amp;quot; workshop took place in Huntingdon at &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;'s Pathfinder House when we arrived there in the afternoon. We set off from &amp;quot;Barnsleigh&amp;quot; station (see what they did there?) at around 9am and headed out to Meadowhall, before switching to Doncaster, Peterborough and then finally Huntingdon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-barnsleigh.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Train arrives at Barnsleigh Station" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that last leg we caught up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marriane&lt;/a&gt; from DXW who had been travelling down separately. With all the trains having been on time, the brief walk into the town centre got us there around lunchtime and so we had time to get food &amp;amp; coffee and then what Marianne referred to as Sugary Bribes for the session. We pitched up to Huntingdon and set up in one of their Civic Rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-discussion.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Discussion by the post it boards" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session went really well! Thank you to everyone who took part and engaged as you did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-20-mapping.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Mapping out process flows" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the rest of our week analysing not only our new findings from Huntingdon but also the shape of our user research overall. It's encouraging to see common themes emerging and how they're mapping out into our &lt;a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png"&gt;Forces framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we head into the festive break now, there won't be an update over the next 2 weeks as our project takes a pause. We'll reconvene on the afternoon of January 6th in a Sprint Planning session and we're spending January 7th in London with the GOV.UK Pay product team which I'm really looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 14</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-14" />
		<updated>2019-12-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;A very busy week and so a long post this time! We've interviewed, we've workshopped, we've reached out, we've analysed survey responses and we've scheduled future activities for all of those things and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The week started on December 9th with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; visiting &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their requirements of an Income Management System. Zoe, Debbie and I were due to attend remotely but the GoTo Meeting software let us down at the last minute and we unfortunately couldn't take part. We did however review the notes after the meeting and by all accounts it was a really useful session. Thank you so much to everyone there who supported that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 10th we popped over to Leeds and ran our agile ceremonies. Starting with our Sprint Review in the morning, we live streamed our very first Show &amp;amp; Tell of the project which is now available to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0"&gt;view on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. We all agreed afterwards that we spoke a little fast and perhaps before the next one we should spend a bit of time getting comfortable. But we're happy with it, it includes everything we wanted to say, and the tech worked great - using DXW's 360 degree &lt;a href="https://www.owllabs.com/meeting-owl"&gt;Meeting Owl Camera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; in their conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed up in the afternoon with our Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning sessions. The Retrospective was particularly useful and gave our Barnsley contingent experience of a new way to run those sessions. Using post-it notes, we individually wrote down things that we'd liked, learned and wished throughout the previous sprint. There was a list of &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; things we noted too. We grouped together and discussed the common themes that were clear to see from us all. From the common wishes and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; items we voted individually on the ones we'd like to focus on over the coming sprint and lifted out the 5 top hitters. Against those we indivdiually wrote post-its identifying how we thought we could deliver against each and grouped those into common actions. The whole exercise was then digitised into a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvkMYm4=/"&gt;Miro Board&lt;/a&gt; and we'll make sure we deliver against the actions in the next sprint. Fantastically useful and a great way to reflect on all the activity to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-13-bradford-team.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday the 11th we ran a user research workshop in the DXW Leeds office with colleagues from &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;. We had originally intended for this to be our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; workshop, inviting councils from our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; who were all roughly grouped together towards the top of the country. However, we quickly hit up against one of the &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;lessons learned in previous Discovery projects&lt;/a&gt; that MHCLG had warned us about - that short notice availability, especially in the run up to Christmas, is a difficult thing to negotiate! So we'll be rescheduling other council's who couldn't attend but in the meantime we got a lot out of the session with Bradford who were fantastic! We also had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle Uzkuraityte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery"&gt;Lisa Jeffery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ImHuYorks"&gt;Imran Hussain&lt;/a&gt; in the room contributing their experience which we very much appreciate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-13-post-its.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week is a bit of a blur if I'm honest as we've had a lot of engagement. Amongst other things we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted &lt;a href="https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/"&gt;Kirklees Council&lt;/a&gt; in response to them contacting us on Twitter. We've added them to our Stakeholder Map and hope to be able to interview them shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Followed up with &lt;a href="https://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/"&gt;Warwick District Council&lt;/a&gt; who partially completed our Local Gov Survey. We've added them to our Stakeholder Map too and we'd love to speak to them in more detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaged in a conversation that Lisa Jeffery started on the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/"&gt;LocalGov Digital slack channel&lt;/a&gt; about our project and in particular some challenges about future of IMS systems generally from &lt;a href="https://www.midlothian.gov.uk/"&gt;Midlothian Council&lt;/a&gt;. Very keen to follow up on this further next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised our train tickets for travelling to Huntingdon on Wednesday where we'll hold our &amp;quot;Southern&amp;quot; workshop with &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted colleagues at our partner &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; to organise a date to interview them remotely in the New Year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised a face to face interview the GOV.UK Pay product team on January 7th next year at their offices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised a face to face interview with &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; on January 14th at their premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received an email from Egle providing advice and guidance on the detail we need to make sure is included in our end of project reports. We'll be digesting that ASAP and make sure our research questions and delivery plan cover the elements we need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented Google Analytics into this blog so we can get an idea of interest and engagement in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 13</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-13" />
		<updated>2019-12-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;If you use or are connected to an Income Management System in Local Government, please take 15 minutes to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12"&gt;complete our Local Government Survey&lt;/a&gt; so that we can better understand IMS requirements across the sector. The data we capture through our survey will supplement findings from our face to face workshops and remote interviews and ultimately help the project to make a recommendation back to MHCLG in relation to our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to complete until some time in early January when we'll need to start processing the information given through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's open we'll continue with our workshops and interviews. On December 4th we carried out our first remote interview with &lt;a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/"&gt;Allerdale Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; who advised they wouldn't be able to make it to our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; workshop but as a partner are integral to our research. We think this interview went really well with Zoe and Debbie connected in from our Barnsley office, Marianne facilitating the session from the DXW office in Leeds and of course Allerdale dialled in from their office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-12-06-allerdale-remote.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Remote interview with Allerdale" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That interview allowed to us to generate the start of our &lt;a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png"&gt;Forces framework&lt;/a&gt;. This will let us see the common problems pushing councils away from their current income management solutions and the benefits they seek that would pull them towards a replacement. At the same time it will highlight their anxieties about moving to new solutions and any concerns they have that might be considered blockers. By mapping out our research findings in this way, we can generate a better understanding of the income management scene in Local Government and plot out the development work needed at an alpha stage to best position our Income Management System to suit their needs - thus answering some of &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. We'll continue to update that framework as we speak with other councils. Already it's also allowed us to refine &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;our question set&lt;/a&gt; for future interviews too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.strategyzer.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Forces_Diagram_Version_Strategyzer-3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Forces Framework" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that was all happening, we have organised a face to face interview on the 9th December with &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; and our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; Workshop is confirmed for the 11th with &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt; due to attend so far. We're also planning to see &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt; on the 18th of December and we're trying to organise to see the GOV.UK Pay product team and &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://www.southnorthants.gov.uk/"&gt;South Northamptonshire Council&lt;/a&gt; in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Zx6cuVodTosFEH2x6"&gt;Expression of Interest Form&lt;/a&gt; remains published for anyone else to get involved too.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 12</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-12" />
		<updated>2019-11-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;With a good understanding of what we're trying to acheive outlined in &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;our Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; we've focussed this week on getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; we've been considering how best to engage and communicate with everyone we'd like to speak to. That includes our bid partners obviously, but also council's who have engaged in income management related work with us in the past. For example, those who supported the previous round 1 funded project - &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/gov-uk-pay-as-a-viable-alternative-e-payment-provider/"&gt;GOV.UK Pay as a viable alternative e-payment provider in local government&lt;/a&gt; and those who joined &lt;a href="20190522"&gt;our first ever public show &amp;amp; tell about our income management system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're spread the length and breadth of the country and so we have to be a little strategic about how we reach them - or as many of them as possible in the time we have available. We had hoped to interview them all individually at their own premises but the logistics of that and the cost of travel these days just don't make that entirely practical. So instead we've grouped them geographically into &amp;quot;North&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;South&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Central&amp;quot; areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've then agreed to use the following methods to conduct our research with them including (in order of our preference):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face to face joint workshops - we'll run one of these in each geographical area and invite as many council's as possible from that area to attend&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Face to face on-site interviews - where it's still practical to do this, we will&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote interviews - for those who can't meet with us in person, but still want to take part&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Online surveys - for those who can't spare as much time, but are still keen to input to our research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, our &amp;quot;Northern&amp;quot; face to face workshop we plan to run on December 11th. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marriane&lt;/a&gt; have issued invites to those in this area and have opened up a space at the &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com/"&gt;DXW Digital Leeds office&lt;/a&gt; for the day. Lunch will be provided and the workshop will, aligned with &lt;a href="/20191122"&gt;our key themes from last week&lt;/a&gt;, ask open questions designed to answer &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our research queries&lt;/a&gt;. The format of the day and accompanying slides are being pulled together as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help with that (and indeed our future face to face workshops), we started this week mapping out the capabilities of our Income Management System and it's limitations. From a document that Zoe and Debbie produced, Marriane extrapolated out a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kweacBY=/"&gt;Miro board&lt;/a&gt; that generated a number of queries. Some were technical, others were simply to clarify understanding. All of them helped to create the initial set of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;open questions that will be asked through the course of our research&lt;/a&gt;, though this will be a living document, adjusted according to our research findings as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that is not to say that this is a closed project. We're keen to speak with any council who wants to support our research and to that end we've published an &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Zx6cuVodTosFEH2x6"&gt;Expression of Interest Form&lt;/a&gt; to allow council's to join in. We'd like to get this in front of council's who may not have heard of the project yet or who are typically less engaged in these sorts of Discovery activities. We'd be very grateful for people sharing this as far and as wide as possible and we'll contact anyone and everyone who completes it. As council's contact us through it, we'll add them to our Stakeholder Map and loop them in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer amount of activity we've gone through this week has lead to us introducing two new tools to our team working arsenal - &lt;a href="https://trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. We've used Trello to map out our activities, identifying their current status and who is working on them. Dragging activity cards between various columns including &amp;quot;To do&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In progress&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot; whilst attaching our faces to the ones we're delivering has really helped us to make sure that everything that needs to be done is getting done, without us falling over each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom is a video conferencing tool that we're using to keep in touch and for our daily 10am standups. It creates a kind of Blankety Blank board (showing my age there!) of attendees and if one person has connectivity issues, it doesn't affect the others or the call itself. On our first day with it, Zoe and I were huddled around her laptop on a call when her battery ran out. Within 30 seconds I'd connected us back in using my personal phone and the call continued. Really easy to use and very flexible - the second day I was held up on the school run and so dialled in on my phone sat in the car outside school and it still worked just perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 11</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-11" />
		<updated>2019-11-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;This week we've brought together all the detail from our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;LDG funding bid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;tender requirements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;YouTube show &amp;amp; tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map which are linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made use of Google Docs, Miro and Slack to do this which have proven to be extremely useful tools, not only for collaborating remotely, but even just to work more openly together when we're sitting in the same room. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; quite nicely put it &amp;quot;Part of the reason for talking [in Slack] rather than via DM [or email] is so that the conversation can be 'overheard' [by all parties]&amp;quot;. Both Google Docs and Slack also include fantastic features that allow you to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; each other working and making changes to documents in real time - you can literally see each other's mouse cursors! Brilliant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-22-miro-collaboration.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Miro showing collaborators pointers working in the same document" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miro in particular has helped us to digitise the post-it notes from our &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; and to draw out some key themes around our ambitions for the project. Getting these on 'paper' - visible in front of us - puts and keeps our team on the same clear page and it sets out effective markers for the scope of what we're up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why we are doing this work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes are we looking for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What organisations and stakeholders are involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes will they get?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to learn or prove?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to communicate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other work relates to this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What difficulties might we expect along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; now cleanly outlines the background to our project, &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;the research queries we need to answer&lt;/a&gt;, the user groups we need support from, the dates we'll be working to and how we'll communicate throughout. Show and tells will be a big part of that and we'll set to work figuring out how to stream those live on YouTube next week for those who want to be involved but can't necessarily attend in person. Our daily standups are likely to use Zoom for the days we're not together too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; identifies absolutely everyone we want to engage with and using an interest vs. influence grid we've put them into 4 key groups to help us manage how we most appropriately communicate with them. Communication tools have been identified to include show &amp;amp; tells, week notes, user research sessions, road mapping exercises, documentation and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; which gives us a bit of freedom to cover off specific needs as and when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1489/1*0rqkQR7ktS_eM7j7rrm_PQ.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interest vs Influence Grid" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we kick an action plan off next week, you might hear from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marianne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;) at DXW Digital. Please keep an eye out for their messages and respond as quickly as possible to enable us to carry out as much research as possible in the time we have available. The more information we can gather now, the better the outcome of the project overall.&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;This week we've brought together all the detail from our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;LDG funding bid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;tender requirements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;YouTube show &amp;amp; tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map which are linked below.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Robyn joins us from &lt;a href="https://barnsley.ac.uk"&gt;Barnsley College&lt;/a&gt;, working 4 days a week split between my web team and our SAP team. On Monday's and Tuesday's she creates SAP programs using ABAP and on Wednesday's and Thursday's she builds websites and digital media tools. She spends her Friday's at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she joined us we'd discovered that she had a talent for developing websites and that she was keen to learn as much as possible during her time with us. As it happened, we needed a new website developing and it was the perfect task for a ground up training exercise. It covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design and layout work, familiarisation with &lt;a href="https://umbraco.com"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt; (our WCM of choice), logo creation and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is now in her 8th week with us (so 16 days, or 3 working weeks) and so far she has wireframed her designs, adopted changes in response to critique from our in-house graphic designer, set up an empty Umbraco instance and began building the website in it AND she's developed a logo and brand identity for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-blog-design.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital website design" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm honestly blown away. Robyn's commitment and enthusiasm is infectious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website she's working on is a collaborative blog that we hope to use to showcase the digital economy in Barnsley. There are lots of fantastic digital projects happening across the borough and we want to provide an online space that can bring them all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mwtsn"&gt;Matt Watson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.makedo.net/"&gt;Make Do Ltd&lt;/a&gt; who donated to us a very fitting domain name, we're calling it Barnsley.Digital which incidentally mirrors similar concepts in other cities and towns - see &lt;a href="https://croydon.digital"&gt;Croydon Digital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digital.gateshead.gov.uk"&gt;Gateshead Digital&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-brand-identity.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital brand identity" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is due to be with us for some time yet and I'm very much looking forward to what else she'll be able to achieve. As her studies progress and her learning with us does too, she'll only improve further and further. Absolutely outstanding! Nice work Robyn!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt; were the succesful bidder in our tender exercise to secure delivery support for our Discovery project. They're a London and Leeds based agency that believe it’s possible for the public sector to become something recognisably, radically better, and want to help make that happen - which is perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sorted out the formalities through Tuesday, our Barnsley contingent set straight to work on Wednesday visiting their trendy Leeds offices and meeting their team. After a tour and a rather tasty coffee (thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/I_am_poss"&gt;Poss&lt;/a&gt;), we made ourselves comfortable in their conference space and set out our expectations for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-15-post-it-notes.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Post-it notes setting out our expectations" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DXW Team (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mmkernohan"&gt;Marianne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;), Debbie, Zoe and I worked through the context of the project, a potted history to date, our ambitions, goals, hopes and dreams for it with a break for lunch somewhere in middle. This sat nicely with &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;the agenda we were anticipating last week&lt;/a&gt; and we used more post-it notes in a single day than I think I've personally used in the last decade! The whole process felt open, creative, flexible but at the same time really well choreographed. The energy only really dropped when someone mentioned lunch and that claimed our focus all too easily. Otherwise we got through an awful lot of material, highlighted a number of considerations, risks, issues and actions that we now need to follow up on - all of which will be digitised and made available as quick as we're able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-15-our-team.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Our team" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our inception meeting. A chance to set out where we are, where we need to be, to generate a shared understanding between us and importantly to gel as a core lead team. Next steps will include engaging with our bid partners (and agreeing with them how best to do this throughout the project), agreeing communication channels and carrying out our joint research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we added our project to Local Digital Pipeline for visibility, documented a functional list of the capabilities of our Income Management System and clarified our availability for further meetings and activities over the remaining 11 weeks of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was a day of rest. We've put together these week notes and caught up with some non-project related activities. Next week, we go again and we're very much looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-9" />
		<updated>2019-11-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We spent the majority of this week scoring bids from interested suppliers and I'm pleased to announce we'll be awarding a contract first thing next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation panel met on Monday and reviewed paper submissions which included outline plans for project delivery, details of resources being deployed, pricing and experience of runnning similar projects to equally tight deadlines. We met with each supplier's teams to discuss their proposals both in person and virtually which helped to firm up our evaluations and get an understanding of how their paper submissions translated to real world practical activities. We ended the week with a real sense of confidence that we'll be able to deliver a meaningful discovery over the remaining 12 weeks of the project (accepting that 2 of those weeks are over the Christmas break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In readiness for a project kick off next week, we've secured a collaboration space in our &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; large enough to seat 7 people comfortably, with media services (Wi-Fi, screens, etc.) and importantly with walls for sticking things to! This is a lockable space that we can set up and leave, to use as we need. Huge thank you to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cr8tveBarnsley"&gt;Tracey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for that! This refers back to one &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;our early lessons in week 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to next week, we're meeting first thing Monday morning and will look to award the contract to the winning bidder as soon as possible. We'll confirm with them the date for our project kick-off and update the project team about when and where that will take place. We'll also need to confirm the agenda but I suspect that will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recap of the previous work carried out by NELC and the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A review of our project and it’s vision, goals and risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look at our timeline and outline project plan to January 31st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion about how we can best work together as a project team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps – planning for our first sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really looking forward to getting into the meat of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;We'll receive copies of all the tender documentation submitted by interested parties early next week. Our colleagues in the corporate procurement team are currently carrying out their due diligence on them. Once we have them, we will begin our evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the week, we'll then meet suppliers and discuss their submissions in more detail, giving us an opportunity to ask any clarifying questions we might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invitation for our bid partners to join us at both of those events is still open, either to join us on-site here in Barnsley or remotely where we can facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-7" />
		<updated>2019-10-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our team in Barnsley have held clarification calls with several interested parties so far this week and we're encouraged by the conversations we've been having. All the questions asked of us have been noted along with our answers and they are being shared openly on our YorTender portal. This means that all suppliers have the benefit of seeing all the same information and will help to make sure all the submissions we receive are as appropriate as possible. We can't say too much about how many suppliers we've spoken with, or who they are as the whole process is confidential by nature, but we are keen to be as open as possible, hence still releasing this shorter blog post this week about how we're progressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on leave next week but the team here will be continuing to receive and answer questions via the portal throughout. When I return, the tender window will have closed and we can review submissions w/c 4th November. We've invited our partners to join us in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers will visit us to discuss their submissions in more detail on November 8th. Again, we've issued an invite to all partners to join us in that on-site here in Barnsley, or remotely where we can support that - keen to have as much involvement as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm conscious we still need to figure out how we're going to work together collaboratively as a project team. At the moment Barnsley continue to lead these early activities and are inviting support and comment at each stage. To that end the agile training hasn't been organised yet but is on our task list of things to do so isn't lost.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 6</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-6" />
		<updated>2019-10-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; are published and ready for interested parties to submit their expressions of interest. We haven't used the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; as we first intended, but rather via &lt;a href="https://www.yortender.co.uk/"&gt;YORTender&lt;/a&gt;, our usual route for obtaining quotes and securing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've opted to take this route based on guidance from our corporate procurement team - the long and short of it being that our organisation doesn't currently use the Digital Marketplace and we have established processes for working with YORtender already - so it makes the whole thing run a lot more smoothly for us and importantly, quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be out to market on YorTender from October 16th to October 30th and will have awarded a contract by Friday 8th November 2019. We therefore intend to kick off project delivery on Monday, November 11th. That revises our anticipated timeline from &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01: Funding awarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 02-09: Procure delivery partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 10-17: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 18-21: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that w/c 23rd December and 30th December will be cut short by the Christmas and New Year break, our 8 week investigative period is only a little over 6 weeks. We'll need to be a bit more savvy with our procurement activities if we make future bids to the fund as the balance is a little off for my liking. Still, it is our first rodeo and we're learning a lot of lessons here that I hope others will appreciate as I keep blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've setup evaluation, award and project kick off meetings with our internal team in plenty of time and I've invited our bid partners to join us in those as of late last night - that can be on site (we love to host) or remotely (which was a major consideration in our bid application initially - that partners wanted to support remotely wherever possible). They'll get copies of bidders documents on November 4th for review and comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, we're looking at booking all of us onto the Agile for Teams course with the GDS Academy. As a successful bidder to the fund, we're entitled to take up that offer. We've sent invites to our partners and hope to hear back from them shortly for a session November 5th, 6th and 7th if that will work. One important thing we need to do as a team still is figure out how we're going to work together collaboratively during this project which is where this course should help. For the timebeing, Barnsley are leading these early activities and inviting support and comment wherever practical. We may continue in that way and as such the agile training may not be necessary but I don't want to close the doors on the chance to work more closely together and certainly that's in the sprit of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

		<updated>2019-10-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;In our haste to bring in some delivery support, we mistakenly published the wrong set of requirements. When we first started drafting them, we went down the road of asking for a Digital Specialist - an individual to come in and support us. However, as we came to understood our needs better, we recognised that we need a Digital Outcome - multiple roles to come together to help us. &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;Our latest set of requirements are seeking a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; but those aren't the ones we published! As a result, all of the questions we received from potential suppliers seemed irrelevant or confused - in fact, some of them were statements advising we ask for an Outcome, which we thought we had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we pulled those from the marketplace after a couple of days and we plan to regroup and go out again next week. Apologies to anyone who submitted a question or showed an interest in helping us with this project. We do still require support and we will be back shortly with the right requirements. To be clear about those, we're looking for an organisation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To run our Discovery project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To marshall our stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To carry out user research workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To document findings into a business/benefits case, a user research report, a conclusion and if appropriate, a funding bid to the Local Digital Fund to proceed with an Alpha project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the succesful organisation will bring at least one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Researcher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Product Owner (although that may be me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delivery manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've listed our user stories as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our stakeholders, bear with us please - we'll be out with our requirements again next week and will be looking to shortlist providers very soon after that. I'll be in touch with dates as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note, to thank Egle at MHCLG for all her support to date, and to Tony Evans for his comments on our requirements as they were being revised. we've found your input extremely useful so thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope next week to be posting less about procurement and more about delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 4</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-4" />
		<updated>2019-10-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Having engaged our Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning Team in &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;week 2&lt;/a&gt;, they subsequently contacted our Corporate Procurement Team this week. Their reasoning being that the value of the contract we're looking to award will be over £70K and so different governance applies. Given &lt;a href="/20190727"&gt;the lessons we learned last week&lt;/a&gt; about engaging all our enablers nice and early, I was really worried this could slam the brakes on for us. That team don't know about this project - they aren't ready for us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we've been very lucky that they've been fantastically accomodating! I actually get the impression they've dropped everything to help us - I'm sure that can't be the case, but that gives you an idea of how supportive they've been. We've actually spent most of the week completing their various document templates that outline the project and the need for us to bring in their support. So far, I've completed and returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procurement Event Approval Document for Research Consultant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officer Decisions Recording Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Privacy Impact Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're taking the information in these documents and organising themselves around our project. They'll work to get &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements&lt;/a&gt; uploaded to the Digital Marketplace as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am hoping that happens really soon as time is ticking away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 3</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-3" />
		<updated>2019-09-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;As week three draws to a close we've completed &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our draft requirements for a Digital Outcome&lt;/a&gt; and we're preparing to publish them. We won't be taking the time to carry out early market engagement as the guidance from the Digital Marketplace suggests we ought to, but that's simply because there isn't much time available for this project. That might come back to bite us, but we'll just have to see how we get on. With a deadline of January 31st 2020 looming it seems to be the most sensible move at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been drafting and redrafting those this week, we've also spent some time reviewing the learning I took when I visited the Local Digital Fund Workshop in London on the 11th. I paid particular attention during the fishbowl discussions when previous discovery projects were highlighting what had worked well and not so well during their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobilising the project team is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;! The day job doesn't just stop. Get to people early. Speak to them. Prepare them. The project is coming, they need to be ready. They may need to move other work. This can takes weeks! Consider your enablers - your IT team, your FM team, your HR team, your web providers, your infrastructure team - anyone who, if not ready, could cause a problem. Speak to them. Prepare them. We've made a start on this one already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare the rest of your organisation. Blog. Send emails. Run awareness sessions. Use the phrase &amp;quot;a condition of the fund...&amp;quot; lots of times. The project will struggle if you need someone unexpectedly and they aren't aware of the project, it's value and it's tight timeline. If your organisation has a staff newsletter, get in it! Set up your communication channels now so they're ready. If your using YouTube for Sprint Reviews, do you have an account? Does your organisation have a channel? Are you allowed to use that channel? Do you need to set up a new blog? Can you use your organisations Twitter account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above is about communication! It's key! Engage your communications team early and start getting messages out now! In all communications, be clear about what it is the project will be doing, who it might need to involve, and what it hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If communications trigger any new interest from stakeholders, grab them with both hands and find a way to utilise them if at all possible. The more information that can be gleaned in a Discovery project, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage your Contracts / Commissioning / Procurement teams. Chances are, given this project is funded, you'll be spending money. Make sure there are arrangements in place for that to be done quickly, effectively and within all procurement rules and guidelines. Last thing you need is to be dealing with a procurement issue in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure a project space - get onto your FM team and secure a room for the duration of the project. You are going to need it, if only to have a quiet space to conduct user research interviews. If it doesn't have conferencing facilities, see if you can get hold of a speaker phone at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you can access tools like Trello, YouTube, Google Docs - some IT teams will block them. Not all of your partner organisations will use Microsoft Word and sometimes you'll have to share in a more open collaborative way. Have a word - make sure you have a way to together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factor in public holidays! This project will run over Christmas/New Year week - don't expect to have that time available. Sounds obvious, but it's a week less than you think you have before you've even started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there any significant management structure changes happening in the organisation that could change the key stakeholders in your plan. What about in your partner organisations - does anyone know? Can you prepare for any of that now in advance so you're not caught out and can react if it does happen? Contact your partners - have that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be honest with your stakeholders, especially the people you're carrying out user research with that you appreciate their effort and that (hopefully not) it might come to nothing. Don't give them unrealistic expectations that their work will individually save £1m for example. Be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be acting on all of these advice points next week! In the meantime we've already begun blogging regularly (weekly) both internally within our organisation and &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk"&gt;externally&lt;/a&gt;. This should help with a lot of the above and help keep the narrative going with partners as we progress. We've also organised access to publish our Show &amp;amp; Tells to the Barnsley Council YouTube channel when they're available.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 2</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-2" />
		<updated>2019-09-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/"&gt;our Discovery project&lt;/a&gt;, we've agreed Barnsley team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Richard Kingston - Product Owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debbie Cooper - Service Owner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoe Crosby - Developer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also engaged with our Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning colleagues. We need their support to make an application to the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Our intent is to make use of the &lt;a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/"&gt;Digital Specialist and Outcomes framework&lt;/a&gt; that the marketplace offers to secure a Delivery Manager. We want to work with someone who is familiar with running Discovery projects, to both run this project and educate our team to be able to run future ones on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, some members of our Digital Team (who we work with very closely) have recently attended the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agile-for-teams-course-description"&gt;GDS Agile for Teams&lt;/a&gt; workshop and we'll be supporting a seperate Discovery project that they're running. Learning from both of these exercises (internally and externally lead) should give us a good handle on how to change the way we work for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this week I've re-read through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-digital-fund-prospectus-2019-to-2020"&gt;Local Digital Fund Prospectus 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; and refreshed our understanding of the scope in which we'll be running this project. I've also noted the project outputs are due at the end of January 2020 which include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a business/benefits case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a user research report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a first draft ‘to be user journey map’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if appropriate, an application for additional funding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gives us 21 working weeks if we accept that the funding was awarded at the end of week 1. Assuming we'll take up to 6 weeks to secure our Delivery Manager, that leaves us up to 14 weeks for the delivery itself. We're breaking that down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01: Funding awarded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 02-07: Procure delivery manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 08-15: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 16-21: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that will become more granular over time, but that's the aspiration at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll share links to all of our documentation, starting with our marketplace requirements shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>£80,000 of Local Digital Funding approved</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-local-digital-funding-approved" />
		<updated>2019-09-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday came &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kingstonrichard/status/1172140492051636224"&gt;the official announcement&lt;/a&gt; that we'd been awarded £80,000 from the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/"&gt;Local Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;our bid to the fund&lt;/a&gt; back in August. We described that the income management function within council's seems uncessarily burdened by legacy software products and there was a change that our in-house developed system could make a difference to that, as &lt;a href="/20190102"&gt;it already has done in Barnsley&lt;/a&gt;. We proposed to spend some money investigating the claim that by allowing other council's to use our system they too could save time and money - and that those savings scaled nationally could add up significantly for the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is effectively awarded to us then, on a speculate to accumulate basis - spending £80K now could lead to savings of hundreds of thousands of pounds from the public purse overall. So, over the coming weeks and months we'll be running a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works"&gt;Discovery project&lt;/a&gt; that will look to answer the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is there a market for an alternative Income Management system to the legacy products that are already out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the user needs for a good Income Management system amongst local authorities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific for Barnsley - what do others need that we haven't thought about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can our income management system integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if our income management system can be shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnsley will lead a collaboration of 6 council's (Barnsley, Sheffield, Allerdale, Cherwell, South Northamptonshire, North East Lincolnshire and Huntingdonshire) and the GOV.UK Pay Product Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step will be to recruit a delivery manager who is familiar with running Discovery projects within the scope of the conditions set out by the fund. They'll produce all the necessary documentation and coordinate research workshops with key stakeholders in our partner organisations. I expect it'll take us up to 6 weeks to organise that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our deadline for completing this project and reporting back to MHCLG who administer the fund is January 31st 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We've branded our "Digi" series</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digi-series-branding-ready" />
		<updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us &lt;a href="/20190402"&gt;name the first three prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that we produced in our Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naming format ties in nicely with our Digital First initiative and gives us a nice model to follow in the future. We're already working on a DigiSafe prototype and there are other ideas in the pipeline that suit too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we set our friendly neighbourhood web designer Aidan Minton (who happens to be a qualified Graphic Designer) to work creating a branding proposal around the &amp;quot;Digi&amp;quot; concept and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digibook-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digidesk-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiDesk branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digimeet-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiMeet branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the concept here is that we can simply change the colour and &lt;NAME&gt; element to suit any new prototype we develop without needing hours of work to produce a new brand each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking next into the possibility of registering a trademark around the naming convention and securing domain names for any marketing / sales websites we might associate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiDesk v3 is alive!</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-v3-is-alive" />
		<updated>2019-07-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPXpI4ZLL34"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EPXpI4ZLL34/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Desk Occupancy Monitor v3.0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set up a demo desk in our maker space at the Barnsley DMC with a keyboard, mouse, screen, desk lamp, and printer. Ideally we'd have had a second screen and a dock rather than a lamp and a printer but this represents a similar level of power usage to our typical office desk setup, so it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of any council ID badge instructs the device to communicate with a central dashboard over Wi-Fi, register the desk as occupied and turn on the power to it. You'll see in the video that the screen, printer and lamp all kick into life. A second quick scan of a badge instructs the device to &amp;quot;de-register&amp;quot; the desk and switch off the power. You'll see that everything switches off almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a lag with it at the moment which is due to the time it takes the device to register/de-register the desk, then re-check the status of the desk. It rechecks to make sure the registration has succeeded, as opposed to just assuming it has. If it were to assume it had when it actually hadn't, the device would end up out of sync and it would end up switching power off when it should be on and vice versa. We plan to speed that up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been working on this, as I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190626"&gt;my last DigiDesk post&lt;/a&gt;, we've also been considering the commercials for it. Branding is underway. We've been speaking with various companies who can create some casing and circuit boards for it to help us bring it to market quickly when we've moved it forward a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting stuff and not bad for only 2 working days worth of effort since that last post!&lt;/p&gt;
