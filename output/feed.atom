		<content>&lt;p&gt;The week started on December 9th with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt; visiting &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; to discuss their requirements of an Income Management System. Zoe, Debbie and I were due to attend remotely but the GoTo Meeting software let us down at the last minute and we unfortunately couldn't take part. We did however review the notes after the meeting and by all accounts it was a really useful session. Thank you so much to everyone there who supported that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 10th we popped over to Leeds and ran our agile ceremonies. Starting with our Sprint Review in the morning, we live streamed our very first Show &amp;amp; Tell of the project which is now available to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/w4-9LmNb0G0"&gt;view on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. We all agreed afterwards that we spoke a little fast and perhaps before the next one we should spend a bit of time getting comfortable. But we're happy with it, it includes everything we wanted to say, and the tech worked great - using DXW's 360 degree &lt;a href="https://www.owllabs.com/meeting-owl"&gt;Meeting Owl Camera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt; in their conference room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed up in the afternoon with our Sprint Retrospective and Sprint Planning sessions. The Retrospective was particularly useful and gave our Barnsley contingent experience of a new way to run those sessions. Using post-it notes, we individually wrote down things that we'd liked, learned and wished throughout the previous sprint. There was a list of &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; things we noted too. We grouped together and discussed the common themes that were clear to see from us all. From the common wishes and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; items we voted individually on the ones we'd like to focus on over the coming sprint and lifted out the 5 top hitters. Against those we indivdiually wrote post-its identifying how we thought we could deliver against each and grouped those into common actions. The whole exercise was then digitised into a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kvkMYm4=/"&gt;Miro Board&lt;/a&gt; and we'll make sure we deliver against the actions in the next sprint. Fantastically useful and a great way to reflect on all the activity to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday the 11th we ran a user research workshop in the DXW Leeds office with colleagues from &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;. We had originally intended for this to be our &amp;quot;northern&amp;quot; workshop, inviting councils from our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; who were all roughly grouped together towards the top of the country. However, we quickly hit up against one of the &lt;a href="20190927"&gt;lessons learned in previous Discovery projects&lt;/a&gt; that MHCLG had warned us about - that short notice availability, especially in the run up to Christmas, is a difficult thing to negotiate! So we'll be rescheduling other council's who couldn't attend but in the meantime we got a lot out of the session with Bradford who were fantastic! We also had &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/egle_a_ieva"&gt;Egle Uzkuraityte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisajjeffery"&gt;Lisa Jeffery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ImHuYorks"&gt;Imran Hussain&lt;/a&gt; in the room contributing their experiences which we very much appreciate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the week is a bit of a blur if I'm honest, but amongst other things we:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted &lt;a href="https://www.kirklees.gov.uk/"&gt;Kirklees Council&lt;/a&gt; in response to them contacting us on Twitter. We hope to be able to interview them shortly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacted colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.cherwell.gov.uk/"&gt;Cherwell District Council&lt;/a&gt; to organise a date to interview them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received an email from Egle providing advice and guidance on the detail we need to make sure is included in our end of project reports. We'll be digesting that ASAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised our train tickets for travelling to &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday where we'll hold a workshop with them, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Followed up with &lt;a href="https://www.warwickdc.gov.uk/"&gt;Warwick District Council&lt;/a&gt; who partially completed our Local Gov Survey. We'd love to speak to them in more detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implemented Google Analytics into this blog so we can get an idea of interest and engagement in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaged in a conversation that Lisa started on the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/"&gt;LocalGov Digital slack channel&lt;/a&gt; about our project and in particular some challenges about future of IMS systems generally. Very keen to follow up on this further next week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised to interview the GOV.UK Pay product team on January 7th next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organised to interview &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; on January 14th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And breathe! I'm off out for Christmas drinks now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 13</title>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;If you use or are connected to an income management system in Local Government, please take 15 minutes to &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12"&gt;fill it in&lt;/a&gt; so we can better understand your requirements. The data we capture through our survey will supplement the findings from our face to face workshops and ultimately help the project to make a recommendation back to MHCLG in relation to our &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;key research queries&lt;/a&gt;. It will be available to complete until some time in early January when we'll need to start processing the information given through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that's happening, we'll be busy gathering information from our partners and stakeholders through a variety of other means. On December 4th we carried out our first remote interview with &lt;a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/"&gt;Allerdale Borough Council&lt;/a&gt; which was very useful and we think went extremely well. Thank you so much to Allerdale for their support with that, we really appreciate it. That interview allowed to us to generate the start of a &lt;a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png"&gt;Forces framework&lt;/a&gt; that we'll now gradually update as we speak with other councils. It also allowed us to refine &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;our question set&lt;/a&gt; for future interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our forces framework lets us see the common problems pushing councils away from their current income management solutions and the benefits they seek that would pull them towards a replacement. At the same time it helps to highlight their anxieties about moving to new solutions and any things that they consider to be blockers. By mapping out our research findings in this way, we can generate a better understanding of the income management scene in Local Government and plot out the development work needed at an alpha stage to best position our Income Management System to suit their needs - thus answering some of &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our key research queries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.strategyzer.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Forces_Diagram_Version_Strategyzer-3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Forces Framework" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as individual remote interviews, we also have face to face workshops planned on the 9th December with &lt;a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/"&gt;North East Lincolnshire Council&lt;/a&gt; and on the 11th with &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/"&gt;Sheffield City Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/"&gt;Bradford Council&lt;/a&gt;. We're hoping to see &lt;a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Huntingdonshire District Council&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/"&gt;South Cambridgeshire District Council&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/"&gt;Cambridgeshire County Council&lt;/a&gt; on the 18th of December and make plans to see the GOV.UK Pay product team and Cherwell in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between now and then we'll be thinking about the best ways to encourage council's to join in with our project.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 12</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-12" />
		<updated>2019-11-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;This will be our &amp;quot;Northern Workshop&amp;quot;, designed to engage with individuals from our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; who are roughly grouped together at the top of the country, closest to where we're based. Our map shows that we're ultimately keen to reach people covering the length and breadth of the country so it's logical to split our research sessions up into geographical areas and run several.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; and Marriane have issued invites to those in this first area and opened up a space at the &lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com/"&gt;DXW Digital Leeds office&lt;/a&gt; for the day. Lunch is being provided and the workshop will, aligned with &lt;a href="/20191122"&gt;our key themes from last week&lt;/a&gt;, ask open questions designed to answer &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;our research queries&lt;/a&gt;. The format of the day and accompanying slides are being pulled together as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help shape up the session (and indeed future workshops), we started this week mapping out the capabilities of our Income Management System and it's limitations. From a document that Zoe and Debbie produced, Marriane extrapolated out a &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kweacBY=/"&gt;Miro board&lt;/a&gt; that generated a number of queries. Some were technical, others were simply to clarify understanding. All of them helped to create the initial set of &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/"&gt;open questions that will be asked through the course of our research&lt;/a&gt;, though this will be a living document, adjusted according to our research findings as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, this week we've also design and issued our &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/Zx6cuVodTosFEH2x6"&gt;Expression of Interest&lt;/a&gt; form - designed to capture details of interested parties who we don't yet have on our Stakeholder Map but who might like to be involved. We'd like to get this in front of council's who may not have heard of the project or who are typically less engaged in these sorts of Discovery activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're currently working on our &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12"&gt;Local Gov Survey&lt;/a&gt; that we'll issue next week - designed to give us both quantative and qualitative data that we can supplement our workshop research with. It takes around 11 minutes to complete and we'd appreciate as many people as possible working through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of activity we've gone through this week has lead to us introducing two new tools to our team working arsenal - &lt;a href="https://trello.com"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://zoom.us"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. We've used Trello to map out our activities, identifying their current status and who is working on them. Dragging activity cards between various columns including &amp;quot;To do&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;In progress&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Done&amp;quot; whilst attaching our faces to the ones we're delivering has really helped us to make sure that everything that needs to be done is getting done, without us falling over each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoom is a video conferencing tool that we're using to keep in touch and for our daily 10am standups. It creates a kind of Blankety Blank board (showing my age there!) of attendees and if one person has connectivity issues, it doesn't affect the others or the call itself. On our first day with it, Zoe and I were huddled around her laptop on a call when her battery ran out. Within 30 seconds I'd connected us back in using my personal phone and the call continued. Really easy to use and very flexible - the second day I was held up on the school run and so dialled in on my phone sat in the car outside school and it still worked just perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More next week!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 11</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-11" />
		<updated>2019-11-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We've brought together all the detail from our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;LDG funding bid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;tender requirements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh4wWuZc1ZA"&gt;YouTube show &amp;amp; tell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk/tags/Income-Management"&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://localdigital.slack.com/archives/CJW65RNAY/"&gt;Slack channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/20191115"&gt;inception week&lt;/a&gt; into a distilled Discovery Plan and Stakeholder Map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made use of Google Docs, Miro and Slack to do this which have proven to be extremely useful tools, not only for collaborating remotely, but even to work more openly together when we're sitting in the same room. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt; quite nicely put it &amp;quot;Part of the reason for talking [in Slack] rather than via DM [or email] is so that the conversation can be 'overheard'&amp;quot;. Both Google Docs and Slack also have fantastic features that allow you to &amp;quot;see&amp;quot; each other working and making changes to documents in real time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-22-miro-collaboration.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Miro showing collaborators pointers working in the same document" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miro in particular has helped us to digitise the post-it notes from our inception week and draw out some key themes around our thinking and our ambitions for the project. Understanding these now puts our team on the same clear page and sets out effective markers for the scope of what we're up to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why we are doing this work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes are we looking for?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What organisations and stakeholders are involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What outcomes will they get?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to learn or prove?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do we need to communicate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other work relates to this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What difficulties might we expect along the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MH5J1GQpceK1ak-hu9DJ-qOOARobZq2vaOS1LwXeSRo/"&gt;Discovery Plan&lt;/a&gt; now more cleanly outlines the background to our project, &lt;a href="/20190916"&gt;the research queries we need to answer&lt;/a&gt;, the user groups we need support from, the dates we'll be working to and how we'll communicate throughout. Show and tells will be a big part of that and we'll set to work figuring out how to stream those live on YouTube next week for those who want to be involved but can't necessarily attend in person. Our daily standups are likely to use Zoom for the days we're not together too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwYo6Ak=/"&gt;Stakeholder Map&lt;/a&gt; identifies absolutely everyone we want to engage with throughout the course of our Discovery work and using an interest vs. influence grid, we've put them into 4 key groups to help us manage how we most appropriately communicate with them. Communication tools have been identified to include show &amp;amp; tells, week notes, user research sessions, road mapping exercises, documentation and &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; which gives us a bit of freedom to cover off specific needs as and when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1489/1*0rqkQR7ktS_eM7j7rrm_PQ.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interest vs Influence Grid" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we kick our communication plan into action next week, you might hear from Sharon, Marianne or James at DXW Digital. Please keep an eye out for their messages and respond as quickly as possible to enable us to carry out as much research as possible in the time we have available. The more information we can gather now, the better the outcome of the project overall.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Robyn joins us from &lt;a href="https://barnsley.ac.uk"&gt;Barnsley College&lt;/a&gt;, working 4 days a week split between my web team and our SAP team. On Monday's and Tuesday's she creates SAP programs using ABAP and on Wednesday's and Thursday's she builds websites and digital media tools. She spends her Friday's at college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she joined us we'd discovered that she had a talent for developing websites and that she was keen to learn as much as possible during her time with us. As it happened, we needed a new website developing and it was the perfect task for a ground up training exercise. It covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, design and layout work, familiarisation with &lt;a href="https://umbraco.com"&gt;Umbraco&lt;/a&gt; (our WCM of choice), logo creation and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is now in her 8th week with us (so 16 days, or 3 working weeks) and so far she has wireframed her designs, adopted changes in response to critique from our in-house graphic designer, set up an empty Umbraco instance and began building the website in it AND she's developed a logo and brand identity for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-blog-design.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital website design" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm honestly blown away. Robyn's commitment and enthusiasm is infectious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website she's working on is a collaborative blog that we hope to use to showcase the digital economy in Barnsley. There are lots of fantastic digital projects happening across the borough and we want to provide an online space that can bring them all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mwtsn"&gt;Matt Watson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.makedo.net/"&gt;Make Do Ltd&lt;/a&gt; who donated to us a very fitting domain name, we're calling it Barnsley.Digital which incidentally mirrors similar concepts in other cities and towns - see &lt;a href="https://croydon.digital"&gt;Croydon Digital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://digital.gateshead.gov.uk"&gt;Gateshead Digital&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-11-19-brand-identity.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Barnsley.Digital brand identity" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robyn is due to be with us for some time yet and I'm very much looking forward to what else she'll be able to achieve. As her studies progress and her learning with us does too, she'll only improve further and further. Absolutely outstanding! Nice work Robyn!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dxw.com"&gt;DXW Digital&lt;/a&gt; were the succesful party, a London and Leeds based agency that believe it’s possible for the public sector to become something recognisably, radically better, and want to help make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having sorted out the formalities through Tuesday, our Barnsley contingent set straight to work on Wednesday visiting their trendy Leeds offices and meeting the team. After a tour and rather tasty coffee (thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/I_am_poss"&gt;Poss&lt;/a&gt;), we made ourselves comfortable in their conference space and set out our expectations for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saulcozens"&gt;Saul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pixlz"&gt;Sharon&lt;/a&gt;, Marianne, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/floppy"&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;, Debbie, Zoe and I worked through the context of the project, a potted history to date, our ambitions, goals, hopes and dreams for it with a break for lunch somewhere in middle. We used more post-it notes in a single day than I think I've personally used in the last decade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole process felt open, creative, flexible but at the same time really well choreographed. The energy only really dropped when someone mentioned lunch and that claimed our focus all too easily. Otherwise we got through an awful lot of material, highlighted a number of considerations, risks, issues and actions that we now need to follow up on - all of which will be digitised and made available as quick as we're able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was our inception meeting. A chance to set out where we are, where we need to be, to generate a shared understanding between us and importantly to gel as a core lead team. Next steps will include engaging with our bid partners (and agreeing with them how best to do this throughout the project), agreeing communication channels and carrying out our joint research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, we added our project to Local Digital Pipeline for visibility, documented a functional list of the capabilities of our Income Management System and clarified our availability for further meetings and activities over the remaining 10 weeks of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday was a day of rest. I've put together these week notes and caught up with some non-project related activities. Next week, we go again and I'm very much looking forward to it!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 9</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-9" />
		<updated>2019-11-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our evaluation panel met on Monday and reviewed paper submissions which included outline plans for project delivery, details of resources being deployed, pricing and experience of runnning similar projects to equally tight deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met with each supplier's teams to discuss their proposals both in person and virtually which helped to firm up our evaluations and get an understanding of how their paper submissions translated to real world practical activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended the week with a real sense of confidence that we'll be able to deliver a meaningful discovery over the remaining 9 weeks of the project (accepting that 2 of those weeks are over the Christmas break).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In readiness for a project kick off next week, we've secured a collaboration space in our &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; large enough to seat 7 people comfortably, with media services (Wi-Fi, screens, etc.) and importantly with walls for sticking things to! This is a lockable space that we can set up and leave, to use as we need. Huge thank you to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cr8tveBarnsley"&gt;Tracey Johnson&lt;/a&gt; for that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking to next week, we're meeting first thing Monday morning and will look to award the contract to the winning bidder as soon as possible. We'll confirm with them the date for our project kick-off and update the project team about when and where that will take place. We'll also need to confirm the agenda but I suspect that will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recap of the previous work carried out by NELC and the GOV.UK Pay team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A review of our project and it’s vision, goals and risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A look at our timeline and outline project plan to January 31st&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A discussion about how we can best work together as a project team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next steps – planning for our first sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're really looking forward to getting into the meat of it now.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Next week will see a tender pack delivered to us and the team here in Barnsley will evaluate them. Towards the end of the week, we'll meet suppliers and discuss their submissions in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invitation for our bid partners to join us at both of those events is open, either to join us on-site here in Barnsley or remotely where we can facilitate it.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 7</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-7" />
		<updated>2019-10-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Our team in Barnsley have held clarification calls with several interested parties so far across the week and we're encouraged by the conversations we've been having. All the questions asked of us have been noted along with our answers and are being shared openly on our YorTender portal. This will help to make sure all the submissions we receive are as appropriate as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say too much about how many suppliers we've spoken with, or who they are as the whole process is confidential by nature, but I am keen to be as open as possible, hence still releasing this shorter blog post this week about how we're progressing just generally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm on leave next week but I expect to be continuing to receive and answer questions via the  portal throughout. When I return, the tender window will have closed and the team here in Barnsley will be reviewing those submissions w/c 4th November. I've invited our partners to join us in that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppliers will visit us to discuss their submissions in more detail on November 8th. Again, I've issued an invite to all partners to join us in that on-site here in Barnsley, or remotely where we can support that - keen to have as much involvement as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm conscious we still need to figure out how we're going to work together as a bid team. At the moment Barnsley continue to lead these early activities and are inviting support and comment at each stage. To that end the agile training hasn't been organised yet but is on our task list of things to do so isn't lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next weeks post may be a few days late as I catch up w/c 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-6" />
		<updated>2019-10-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Not on the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; as we first intended, but rather via &lt;a href="https://www.yortender.co.uk/"&gt;YORTender&lt;/a&gt;, our usual route for obtaining quotes and securing suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've opted to take this route based on guidance from our corporate procurement team - the long and short of it being that our organisation doesn't currently use the Digital Marketplace and we have established processes for working with YORtender already - so it makes the whole thing run a lot more smoothly for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll be out to market from October 16th to October 30th and will have awarded by Friday 8th November 2019. We intend to kick off delivery on Monday, November 11th. That revises our anticipated timeline from &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;Week 2&lt;/a&gt; to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01-09: Procure delivery partner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 10-18: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 19-20: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accepting that w/c 23rd December and 30th December will be cut short by the Christmas and New Year break, our 8 week investigative period is only a little over 6 weeks. We'll need to be a bit more savvy with our procurement activities if we make future bids to the fund as the balance is a little off for my liking. Still, it is our first rodeo and we're learning a lot of lessons here that I hope others will appreciate as I keep blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've setup evaluation, award and project kick off meetings with our internal stakeholders already and I've invited our bid partners to join us in those as of late last night - that can be on site (we love to host) or remotely (which was a major consideration in our bid application - that partners wanted to support remotely wherever possible). They'll get copies of bidders documents on November 4th for review and comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I'm looking at booking our team onto the Agile for Teams course with the GDS Academy. As a successful bidder to the fund, we're entitled to take up that offer. I've sent invites to our partners and hope to hear back from them shortly for a session November 5th, 6th and 7th if that will work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing we do need to do as a team still is figure out how we're going to work together across the duration of the project. For the timebeing, Barnsley are leading these early activities and inviting support and comment wherever practical. We may continue in that way and as such the agile training may not be necessary but I don't want to close the doors on the chance to work more closely together and certainly that's in the sprit of the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll post again next week with more information.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 5</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-5" />
		<updated>2019-10-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Turns out we published &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;our earlier draft requirements&lt;/a&gt; that were asking for a Digital Specialist, rather than the latest version that asks for a Digital Outcome. As a result, all of the questions we received seemed irrelevant or confused - in fact, some of them were more statements advising we ask for an outcome, which we thought we had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we pulled them again today and we plan to regroup and go out again next week. Apologies to anyone who submitted a question or showed an interest in the work. We do still require support and we will be back shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we're looking for an organisation to run our Discovery project. To marshall our stakeholders and carry out user research workshops with them. To document findings into a business/benefits case, a user research report, a conclusion and if appropriate, a funding bid to the Local Digital Fund to proceed with an Alpha project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally the succesful organisation will bring at least one: user researcher, service designer, product owner, delivery manager to get us to that point within the timescales set out by the fund - 31st January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've listed our user stories as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As Barnsley IM Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required to it to meet national user needs so I can develop it such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA Income Manager, I need to know if my needs will be met and the savings I can make, so that I can consider migrating over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a GOV.UK Pay Product Owner, I need to understand the changes required for integration so I can develop such.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As an LA ICT manager, I need to know how the solution will be packaged so that I understand how to implement and support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's much more detail in the Google Sheet linked above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our stakeholders, bear with us please - we'll be out with our requirements again next week and will be looking to shortlist providers very soon after that. I'll be in touch with dates as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note, to thank Egle at MHCLG for all her support to date, and to Tony Evans for his comments on our requirements as they were being revised. we've found your input extremely useful so thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope next week to be posting less about procurement and more about delivery. Watch this space.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 4</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-4" />
		<updated>2019-10-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Having engaged our Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning Team in &lt;a href="/20190920"&gt;week 2&lt;/a&gt;, they've subsequently involved our Corporate Procurement Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasoning behind that is that the value of the contract we're looking to award will be over £70K and so presumably that hits some sort of internal trigger. So, I've been engaged with Corporate Procurment for most of the week completing various document templates that outline the project and the need for us to bring in support. So far, I've completed and returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Procurement Event Approval Document for Research Consultant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officer Decisions Recording Process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Privacy Impact Assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our colleagues in Corporate Procurement are taking the information from those documents to complete their own work and get our requirements uploaded to the Digital Marketplace - I'm hoping that happens really soon as time is ticking away quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from that I'm afraid there's been little progress. I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190927"&gt;last week's lessons&lt;/a&gt; that the day job doesn't just immediately stop and true to that I've been swamped in other business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent 2 days in Bridlington at the &lt;a href="https://www.humbercaretech.co.uk"&gt;Humber Care Tech Challenge&lt;/a&gt; with a 5 person team that I'd pulled together, looking at how we could help sufferers of dementia and their carers. That was a really worthwhile event and I hope to attend future ones. I'll blog about that seperately though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to week 5.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 3</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-3" />
		<updated>2019-09-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;You can read our requirements in full at &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4"&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MkzvoOmTRZtSGT18-xSNxeOWNiPkZG7phRg0BUPJsI4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't taken the time to carry out early market engagement simply because there isn't much time available. That might come back to bite us, but we'll see how we get on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also spent some time reviewing the learning I took when I visited the Local Digital Fund Workshop in London on the 11th. I paid particular attention during the fishbowl discussions when previous discovery projects were highlighting what had worked well and not so well during their work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobilising the project team is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;! The day job doesn't just stop. Get to people early. Speak to them. Prepare them. The project is coming, they need to be ready. They may need to move other work. This can takes weeks! Consider your enablers - your IT team, your FM team, your HR team, your web providers, your infrastructure team - anyone who, if not ready, could cause a problem. Speak to them. Prepare them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prepare the rest of your organisation. Blog. Send emails. Run awareness sessions. Use the phrase &amp;quot;a condition of the fund...&amp;quot; lots of times. The project will struggle if you need someone unexpectedly and they aren't aware of the project, it's value and it's tight timeline. If your organisation has a staff newsletter, get in it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up your communication channels now so they're ready. If your using YouTube for Sprint Reviews, do you have an account? Does your organisation have a channel? Are you allowed to use that channel? Do you need to set up a new blog? Can you use your organisations Twitter account?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above is about communication! It's key! Engage your communications team early and start getting messages out now! In all communications, be clear about what it is the project will be doing, who it might need to involve, and what it hopes to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If communications trigger any new interest from stakeholders, grab them with both hands and find a way to utilise them if at all possible. The more information that can be gleaned in a Discovery project, the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engage your Contracts / Commissioning / Procurement teams. Chances are, given this project is funded, you'll be spending money. Make sure there are arrangements in place for that to be done quickly, effectively and within all procurement rules and guidelines. Last thing you need is to be dealing with a procurement issue in the middle of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure a project space - get onto your FM team and secure a room for the duration of the project. You are going to need it, if only to have a quiet space to conduct user research interviews. If it doesn't have conferencing facilities, see if you can get hold of a speaker phone at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you can access tools like Trello, YouTube, Google Docs - some IT teams will block them. Not all of your partner organisations will use Microsoft Word and sometimes you'll have to share in a more open collaborative way. Have a word - make sure you have a way to together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Factor in public holidays! This project will run over Christmas/New Year week - don't expect to have that time available. Sounds obvious, but it's a week less than you think you have before you've even started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there any significant management structure changes happening in the organisation that could change the key stakeholders in your plan. What about in your partner organisations - does anyone know? Can you prepare for any of that now in advance so you're not caught out and can react if it does happen? Contact your partners - have that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be honest with your stakeholders, especially the people you're carrying out user research with that you appreciate their effort and that (hopefully not) it might come to nothing. Don't give them unrealistic expectations that their work will individually save £1m for example. Be open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be acting on all of these advice points next week! In the meantime I've already begun blogging regularly (weekly) both internally within our organisation and &lt;a href="https://kingstonrichard.uk"&gt;externally&lt;/a&gt;. This should help with a lot of the above and help keep the narrative going with partners as we progress.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>IMS Discovery - Week 2</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/ims-discovery-week-2" />
		<updated>2019-09-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/09/12/the-6-projects-funded-in-round-2-of-the-local-digital-fund/"&gt;our Discovery project&lt;/a&gt;, I've engaged our internal Contracts &amp;amp; Commissioning team to support our application to the &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/"&gt;Digital Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. We'll be making use of the &lt;a href="https://digitalmarketplace.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/27/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-an-overview/"&gt;Digital Specialist and Outcomes framework&lt;/a&gt; to secure a Delivery Manager. Our intent here is to work with someone who is familiar with running discovery projects to both run this project and educate our team to be able to run future ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel to this, some of our internal team attended the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/agile-for-teams-course-description"&gt;GDS Agile for Teams&lt;/a&gt; workshop a couple of weeks ago and we're running a seperate Discovery project with them. Both of these exercises should give us a good handle on how to change the way we work for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've re-read through the &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/local-digital-fund-prospectus-2019-to-2020"&gt;Local Digital Fund Prospectus 2019/20&lt;/a&gt; and noted the project outputs are due at the end of January 2020. That's 20 weeks from the date of the award. Assuming 4-6 weeks to secure a delivery manager, that leaves us up to 16 weeks for the delivery itself. I'm breaking that down as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 01-06: Procure delivery manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 07-15: Run investigative workshops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Week 16-20: Document outputs into reports&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously that will break down into a more granular plan over time, but that's the aspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share links to all of our documentation, starting with our marketplace requirements shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday came &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kingstonrichard/status/1172140492051636224"&gt;the official announcement&lt;/a&gt; that we'd been awarded the maximum £80,000 from the &lt;a href="https://localdigital.gov.uk/fund/"&gt;Local Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I4EPlTWphcculCRcoeXt-2leX4F8AGTL2XGG9sBE9P4"&gt;our bid to the fund&lt;/a&gt; back in August, on the premise that the income management function within council's was uncessarily burdened by legacy software products and that our in-house development could make a real difference as it has done in Barnsley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proposed to spend some money investigating the claim that by allowing other council's to use our system they too could save time and money as we have - and that those savings, when scaled nationally, would add up significantly for the public sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money is effectively awarded to us on a speculate to accumulate basis - the idea that by spending £80K now, we can potentially save hundreds of thousands of pounds from the public purse overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, over the coming weeks and months we'll be running a Discovery project that will answer the following research queries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether there is a market for an alternative Income Management system to those legacy products already out there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what are the user needs for a good Income Management product amongst local authorities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system meets the needs of other council's or have we built it too specific to our needs and set up - what do they need that we haven't thought about?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether changes can be made to our income management system where gaps are identified in it meeting the user needs of other councils - what might those changes be?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether our income management system can integrate successfully with GOV.UK Pay to offer a more holistic solution for accepting income and then processing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if an income management system could be built and shared within the public sector, what is the best way to ensure a cost-effective, well-supported solution for council's?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing this, we are the lead in a collaboration of 6 council's (Barnsley, Sheffield, Allerdale, Cherwell &amp;amp; South Northamptonshire, North East Lincolnshire and Huntingdonshire) and the GOV.UK Pay Product Team. There's also keen interest from West Berkshire, Hackney and Oxfordshire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step will be to recruit a delivery manager - someone familiar with running Discovery projects within the guidance set out by the conditions of the fund. They'll produce all the necessary documentation and coordinate research workshops with key stakeholders in our partner organisations over a 12 week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expect it'll take us 4-6 weeks to source that person and so we should be seeing results from the project early in the New Year. Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>We've branded our "Digi" series</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digi-series-branding-ready" />
		<updated>2019-08-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who helped us &lt;a href="/20190402"&gt;name the first three prototypes&lt;/a&gt; that we produced in our Innovation Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This naming format ties in nicely with our Digital First initiative and gives us a nice model to follow in the future. We're already working on a DigiSafe prototype and there are other ideas in the pipeline that suit too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we set our friendly neighbourhood web designer Aidan Minton (who happens to be a qualified Graphic Designer) to work creating a branding proposal around the &amp;quot;Digi&amp;quot; concept and here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digibook-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digidesk-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiDesk branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-08-06-digimeet-branding.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiMeet branding" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of the concept here is that we can simply change the colour and &lt;NAME&gt; element to suit any new prototype we develop without needing hours of work to produce a new brand each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're looking next into the possibility of registering a trademark around the naming convention and securing domain names for any marketing / sales websites we might associate with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards and upwards!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiDesk v3 is alive!</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digidesk-v3-is-alive" />
		<updated>2019-07-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPXpI4ZLL34"&gt;&lt;img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/EPXpI4ZLL34/0.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Desk Occupancy Monitor v3.0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've set up a demo desk in our maker space at the Barnsley DMC with a keyboard, mouse, screen, desk lamp, and printer. Ideally we'd have had a second screen and a dock rather than a lamp and a printer but this represents a similar level of power usage to our typical office desk setup, so it's all good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick scan of any council ID badge instructs the device to communicate with a central dashboard over Wi-Fi, register the desk as occupied and turn on the power to it. You'll see in the video that the screen, printer and lamp all kick into life. A second quick scan of a badge instructs the device to &amp;quot;de-register&amp;quot; the desk and switch off the power. You'll see that everything switches off almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a lag with it at the moment which is due to the time it takes the device to register/de-register the desk, then re-check the status of the desk. It rechecks to make sure the registration has succeeded, as opposed to just assuming it has. If it were to assume it had when it actually hadn't, the device would end up out of sync and it would end up switching power off when it should be on and vice versa. We plan to speed that up though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we've been working on this, as I mentioned in &lt;a href="/20190626"&gt;my last DigiDesk post&lt;/a&gt;, we've also been considering the commercials for it. Branding is underway. We've been speaking with various companies who can create some casing and circuit boards for it to help us bring it to market quickly when we've moved it forward a little further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting stuff and not bad for only 2 working days worth of effort since that last post!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Digital Campus - DMC2 is go!</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digital-campus-go" />
		<updated>2019-07-05T00:00:00Z</updated>

It was the first meeting we'd had since December but while it's been &amp;quot;quiet&amp;quot; for the group as a whole, there has been a whole lot of activity happening behind the scenes with individual parties!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not least of which is the design and delivery of the new DMC2 building - which Ben Hawley described as the most creatively name building anywhere in the world (or something along those lines). Haha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind DMC2 is that the Barnsley Digital Media Centre is at capacity right now in terms of being able to house new digital businesses . It's so popular as a venue in fact, that it even has a queue of businesses waiting to move in. Couple that with the businesses already in there growing and essentially, there's a demand for more space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, previously known as The Core, DMC2 will be refurbished between now and March 2020 with floors 1, 2 and 3 being growing space for the DMC. There'll be a large makerspace included, plenty of coworking / hotdesking space and it sounds like most of the building is already let to tenants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited for this - especially the makerspace as you might expect, but also the opportunities the building will create for being able to talk to experts from other companies - to share knowledge, to work on joint projects and to truly collaborate across sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also looks amazing! There is a flythrough of the new design on Vimeo that was shared with us and the attention to detail in it's fantastic. The video is marked &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; right now, so I can't share it, but I hope to be able to soon.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiDesk - the next iteration (v3)</title>

You can read about &lt;a href="/20190121"&gt;our CIF visit&lt;/a&gt; in my earlier post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaun and I spent some time with the Enterprising Barnsley Team, attending their series of Launchpad events. Based at the &lt;a href="https://www.barnsleydmc.co.uk"&gt;Barnsley Digital Media Centre&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.enterprisingbarnsley.co.uk/start-up/"&gt;Launchpad service&lt;/a&gt; provides a dedicated team who will support anyone in Barnsley who is looking to start a business, no matter what stage their idea or business is at. For us of course, DigiBook is an early stage prototype that we hope to sell and so we were keen to get a solid understanding of how the commercial aspects would work. They're events provide that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, having learned A LOT we've agree to revise the design of the solution a little further. It will still maintain the visibility of where busy and free desks are but it will now go a step further and identify who is sitting where which we hope will be able to update Skype and possibly SharePoint automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It'll work by replacing the button on the device with a scanner for our staff ID badges. Simply touch your badge on the device, and it will register that desk to you until you scan your badge again. To incentivise us all to do that, it will also control the power sockets on desks too. When you take a desk, the power will come on (i.e. screens, docks, etc.). When you release a desk the power will go off. This offers some good savings opportunities on our electricity bill if nothing else, bearing in mind that every desks costs money every day whether someone is using it or not currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all an idea at this stage, so I'll post again as we get a working prototype of this going. Would love to know what you think in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>DigiBook is taking shape</title>
		<link href="http://kingstonrichard.uk/posts/digibook-taking-shape" />
		<updated>2019-06-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We secured funding from the Commercial Investment board back in January to make that happen and since then we've been refactoring the code to work in a multi-tenanted SaaS (software as a service) environment, we've attended several Launchpad sessions and we've organised the design for its final form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That form factor includes a bespoke stand from RA Systems, fabricated from British Steel, powder coated and made in such a way that it can be adapted to be wall mountied, desk mounted or floor mounted. The original stand we piloted with is a little unstable we've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook close up photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictured here is the floor mounted option with it's optional extra label printer that can be purchased as an additional module. The 10 inch tablet sits perfectly in the enclosure with space alongside for an RFID module that can also be bought as an added extra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the innovation group this Wednesday, we'll be finalising the software design, applying branding as the Code Green DigiBook solution and then the sales and marketing work begins. We already have several potential customers lined up and of course our own buildings are already benefiting and have been for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/2019-06-24-digibook-tablet-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DigiBook full length photo" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really pleased with how this has turned out so far.&lt;/p&gt;
