<p>Our <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12">Local Gov Survey</a> is live and we need your help!</p>
<p>If you use or are connected to an income management system in Local Government, please take 15 minutes to <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/BMBCIMS12">fill it in</a> so we can better understand your requirements. The data we capture through our survey will supplement the findings from our face to face workshops and ultimately help the project to make a recommendation back to MHCLG in relation to our <a href="/20190916">key research queries</a>. It will be available to complete until some time in early January when we'll need to start processing the information given through it.</p>
<p>While that's happening, we'll be busy gathering information from our partners and stakeholders through a variety of other means. On December 4th we carried out our first remote interview with <a href="https://www.allerdale.gov.uk/">Allerdale Borough Council</a> which was very useful and we think went extremely well. Thank you so much to Allerdale for their support with that, we really appreciate it. That interview allowed to us to generate the start of a <a href="https://dxw.slack.com/files/UF8061ZPU/FRCK08E5N/screenshot_2019-12-06_at_08.24.50.png">Forces framework</a> that we'll now gradually update as we speak with other councils. It also allowed us to refine <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZjEP1m2z3UPqHzikuIyPsWyCdw5m7SPT_fKI93T1ag/">our question set</a> for future interviews.</p>
<p>Our forces framework lets us see the common problems pushing councils away from their current income management solutions and the benefits they seek that would pull them towards a replacement. At the same time it helps to highlight their anxieties about moving to new solutions and any things that they consider to be blockers. By mapping out our research findings in this way, we can generate a better understanding of the income management scene in Local Government and plot out the development work needed at an alpha stage to best position our Income Management System to suit their needs - thus answering some of <a href="/20190916">our key research queries</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.strategyzer.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Forces_Diagram_Version_Strategyzer-3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Forces Framework" /></p>
<p>As well as individual remote interviews, we also have face to face workshops planned on the 9th December with <a href="https://www.nelincs.gov.uk/">North East Lincolnshire Council</a> and on the 11th with <a href="https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/">Sheffield City Council</a> and <a href="https://www.bradford.gov.uk/">Bradford Council</a>. We're hoping to see <a href="https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/">Huntingdonshire District Council</a>, <a href="https://www.scambs.gov.uk/">South Cambridgeshire District Council</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/">Cambridgeshire County Council</a> on the 18th of December and make plans to see the GOV.UK Pay product team and Cherwell in the New Year.</p>
<p>Between now and then we'll be thinking about the best ways to encourage council's to join in with our project.</p>
