<p>Our team in Barnsley have held clarification calls with several interested parties so far across the week and we're encouraged by the conversations we've been having. All the questions asked of us have been noted along with our answers and are being shared openly on our YorTender portal. This will help to make sure all the submissions we receive are as appropriate as possible.</p>
<p>I can't say too much about how many suppliers we've spoken with, or who they are as the whole process is confidential by nature, but I am keen to be as open as possible, hence still releasing this shorter blog post this week about how we're progressing just generally.</p>
<p>I'm on leave next week but I expect to be continuing to receive and answer questions via the  portal throughout. When I return, the tender window will have closed and the team here in Barnsley will be reviewing those submissions w/c 4th November. I've invited our partners to join us in that.</p>
<p>Suppliers will visit us to discuss their submissions in more detail on November 8th. Again, I've issued an invite to all partners to join us in that on-site here in Barnsley, or remotely where we can support that - keen to have as much involvement as possible.</p>
<p>I'm conscious we still need to figure out how we're going to work together as a bid team. At the moment Barnsley continue to lead these early activities and are inviting support and comment at each stage. To that end the agile training hasn't been organised yet but is on our task list of things to do so isn't lost.</p>
<p>Next weeks post may be a few days late as I catch up w/c 4th.</p>
