<p>This morning I've spent a couple of hours down at Central Library​ with my 5 year old, taking part in one of the Summer <a href="https://www.barnsley.gov.uk/services/libraries/mini-makers-at-barnsley-libraries/">Mini Makers</a> workshops that are being run right over the 6 week holidays.</p>
<p>They're moving between our various library buildings and are designed to encourage children to get involved in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) activities.</p>
<p>Called the <a href="https://twitter.com/MakEY_Project">MakEY Project</a>, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, they're part of a research study by the University of Sheffield to determine how makerspaces in libraries can foster the digital literacy skills and knowledge of children, and their creativity / creative design skills.</p>
<p>And Rowan has had an absolute blast today! We started by making a DrawBot with paper cups, lollipop sticks, felt tip pens, and a motor that when switched on, bounced it's way around a paper sheet drawing colourful patterns. Rowan named his &quot;Kyle&quot; (I don't know why!?) and gave it just the one eye.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018-07-25-ro-and-me.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Rowan holding his DrawBot" /></p>
<p>Then we moved onto the next table where he drew a blueberry ice cream, a tree, a spider, a &quot;Blue England Flag&quot; and a sunshine up in the corner. Using conductive tape, we added an LED and made the sunshine light up. He was chuffed to bits!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2018-07-25-rowan-card.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Rowan holding his electronic picture" /></p>
<p>It was then onto the Play Doh table - it turns out that stuff can carry a current (who knew!?) and so we made a couple of weiners, hooked them up to a battery pack and branched LED's across them to make a circuit. Hey presto, light up Play Doh!</p>

<p>Finally we had a crack at some stop motion photography using... get this... an overhead projector. It's been 20 years since I last saw one of those at school. Link it up with an iPad running iMotion though and you have everything you need to make a movie. We plan to set something up at home with all his Lego trucks and cars.</p>
<p>There was even a fruit piano to have a go at, although it wasn't working when we were there. Bananas as piano keys. Touch a banana, the computer plays a note. No idea how that was working, but I'll look it up. I'm sure there's a practical use to think of ;-)</p>
<p>All in all, a cracking session which Rowan has loved. At one point he said to me &quot;Everyime you come to the Library Daddy, I want to come too, it's awesome!&quot;. Can't say fairer than that.</p>
<p>The workshops are drop in sessions, so you don't need to book a place, just go along and join in the fun! Link above give dates and times.</p>
