    <h2>Digital Campus - DMC2 is go!</h2>
        <p>Following the launch of Barnsley&#x27;s TechTown Action Plan - A Digital Campus, it was great to catch up with the working group yesterday morning down at the DMC.&#x200B;</p>

It was the first meeting we'd had since December but while it's been &quot;quiet&quot; for the group as a whole, there has been a whole lot of activity happening behind the scenes with individual parties!</p>
<p>Not least of which is the design and delivery of the new DMC2 building - which Ben Hawley described as the most creatively name building anywhere in the world (or something along those lines). Haha!</p>
<p>The idea behind DMC2 is that the Barnsley Digital Media Centre is at capacity right now in terms of being able to house new digital businesses . It's so popular as a venue in fact, that it even has a queue of businesses waiting to move in. Couple that with the businesses already in there growing and essentially, there's a demand for more space.</p>
<p>And so, previously known as The Core, DMC2 will be refurbished between now and March 2020 with floors 1, 2 and 3 being growing space for the DMC. There'll be a large makerspace included, plenty of coworking / hotdesking space and it sounds like most of the building is already let to tenants!</p>
<p>I'm excited for this - especially the makerspace as you might expect, but also the opportunities the building will create for being able to talk to experts from other companies - to share knowledge, to work on joint projects and to truly collaborate across sectors.</p>
<p>It also looks amazing! There is a flythrough of the new design on Vimeo that was shared with us and the attention to detail in it's fantastic. The video is marked &quot;private&quot; right now, so I can't share it, but I hope to be able to soon.</p>
